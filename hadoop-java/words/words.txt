up to date first edition [xxxxx  x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce 
million dollars per hour this year we, will have to do four text
files per month:  thus upping our productivity from one million.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December   ,   .  [  ,  ,,=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is   % of the expected number of computer users by the end
of the year   .

THE SONNETS

by William Shakespeare



                       
  From fairest creatures we desire increase,
  That thereby beauty  rose might never die,
  But as the riper should by time decease,
  His tender heir might bear his memory:
  But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
  Feed thy light  flame with self-substantial fuel,
  Makingfamine where abundance lies,
  Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
  Thou that art now the world  fresh ornament,
  And only herald to the gaudy spring,
  Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
  And tender churl mak waste in niggarding:
    Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
    To eat the world  due, by the grave and thee.


                     
  When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
  And dig deep trenches in thy beauty  field,
  Thy youth  proud livery so gazed on now,
  Will betattered weed of small worth held:  
  Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,
  Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
  To say within thine own deep sunken eyes,
  Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
  How much more praise deserved thy beauty  use,
  If thou couldst answer eThis fair child of mine
  Shall sum my count, and make my old excusee
  Proving his beauty by succession thine.
    This were to be new made when thou art old,
    And see thy blood warm when thou feel it cold.


                     
  Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest,
  Now is the time that face should form another,
  Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
  Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
  For where is she so fair whose uneared womb
  Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
  Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,
  Of his self-love to stop posterity?  
  Thou art thy mother  glass and she in thee
  Calls back the lovely April of her prime,
  So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
  Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
    But if thou live remembered not to be,
    Die single and thine image dies with thee.


                     
  Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend,
  Upon thy self thy beauty  legacy?
  Nature  bequest gives  but doth lend,
  And being frank she lends to those are free:
  Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse,
  The bounteous largess given thee to give?
  Profitless usurer why dost thou use
  So greatsum of sums yet canst not live?
  For having traffic with thy self alone,
  Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive,
  Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,
  What acceptable audit canst thou leave?  
    Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,
    Which used lives the executor to be.


                     
  Those hours that with gentle work did frame
  The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
  Will play the tyrants to the very same,
  And that unfair which fairly doth excel:
  For never-resting time leads summer on
  To hideous winter and confounds him there,
  Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,
  Beauty oeer-snowed and bareness every where:
  Then were not summer  distillation left
 liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
  Beauty  effect with beauty were bereft,
  Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.
    But flowers distilled though they with winter meet,
    Leese but their show, their substance still lives sweet.


                       
  Then let not winter  ragged hand deface,
  In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:
  Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place,
  With beauty  treasure ere it be self-killed:
  That use is not forbidden usury,
  Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
  That  for thy self to breed another thee,
  Or ten times happier be it ten for one,
  Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,
  If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:
  Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,
  Leaving thee living in posterity?
    Be not self-willed for thou art much too fair,
    To be death  conquest and make worms thine heir.


                     
  Lo in the orient when the gracious light
  Lifts up his burning head, each under eye
  Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
  Serving with looks his sacred majesty,  
  And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,
  Resembling strong youth in his middle age,
  Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
  Attending on his golden pilgrimage:
  But when from highmost pitch with weary car,
  Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,
  The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are
  From his low tract and look another way:
    So thou, thy self out-going in thy noon:
    Unlooked on diest unless thou getson.


                       
  Music to hear, why hear thou music sadly?
  Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:
  Why lov thou that which thou receiv not gladly,
  Or else receiv with pleasure thine annoy?
  If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
  By unions married do offend thine ear,
  They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
  In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:  
  Mark how one string sweet husband to another,
  Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;
  Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,
  Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:
    Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,
    Sings this to thee, eThou single wilt prove nonee.


                     
  Is it for fear to wetwidow  eye,
  That thou consum thy self in single life?
  Ah, if thou issueless shalt hap to die,
  The world will wail thee likemakeless wife,
  The world will be thy widow and still weep,
  That thou no form of thee hast left behind,
  When every private widow well may keep,
  By children  eyes, her husband  shape in mind:
  Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
  Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;
  But beauty  waste hath in the world an end,
  And kept unused the user so destroys it:  
    No love toward others in that bosom sits
    That on himself such murderous shame commits.


                       
  For shame deny that thou bear love to any
  Who for thy self art so unprovident.
  Grant if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,
  But that thou none lov is most evident:
  For thou art so possessed with murderous hate,
  That egainst thy self thou stick not to conspire,
  Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
  Which to repair should be thy chief desire:
 change thy thought, thatmay change my mind,
  Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?
  Be as thy presence is gracious and kind,
  Or to thy self at least kind-hearted prove,
    Make thee another self for love of me,
    That beauty still may live in thine or thee.


                           
  As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou grow t,
  In one of thine, from that which thou departest,
  And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow t,
  Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest,
  Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,
  Without this folly, age, and cold decay,
  If all were minded so, the times should cease,
  And threescore year would make the world away:
  Let those whom nature hath not made for store,
  Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:
  Look whom she best endowed, she gave thee more;
  Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:
    She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,
    Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.


                       
  Whendo count the clock that tells the time,
  And see the brave day sunk in hideous night,
  Whenbehold the violet past prime,
  And sable curls all silvered oeer with white:  
  When lofty treessee barren of leaves,
  Which erst from heat did canopy the herd
  And summer  green all girded up in sheaves
  Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:
  Then of thy beauty doquestion make
  That thou among the wastes of time must go,
  Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,
  And die as fast as they see others grow,
    And  egainst Time  scythe can make defence
    Save breed to brave him, when he takes thee hence.


                       
 that you were your self, but love you are
  No longer yours, than you your self here live,
  Against this coming end you should prepare,
  And your sweet semblance to some other give.
  So should that beauty which you hold in lease
  Find no determination, then you were
  Your self again after your self  decease,
  When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.  
  Who lets so fairhouse fall to decay,
  Which husbandry in honour might uphold,
  Against the stormy gusts of winter  day
  And barren rage of death  eternal cold?
   none but unthrifts, dear my love you know,
    You hadfather, let your son say so.


                       
  Not from the stars domy judgement pluck,
  And yet methinkshave astronomy,
  But not to tell of good, or evil luck,
  Of plagues, of dearths, or seasonse quality,
  Nor canfortune to brief minutes tell;
  Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
  Or say with princes if it shall go well
  By oft predict thatin heaven find.
  But from thine eyes my knowledgederive,
  And constant stars in themread such art
  As truth and beauty shall together thrive
  If from thy self, to store thou wouldst convert:  
    Or else of thee thisprognosticate,
    Thy end is truth  and beauty  doom and date.


                       
  Whenconsider every thing that grows
  Holds in perfection butlittle moment.
  That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
  Whereon the stars in secret influence comment.
  Whenperceive that men as plants increase,
  Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky:
  Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
  And wear their brave state out of memory.
  Then the conceit of this inconstant stay,
  Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
  Where wasteful time debateth with decay
  To change your day of youth to sullied night,
    And all in war with Time for love of you,
    As he takes from you,engraft you new.


                         
  But wherefore do not youmightier way
  Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time?
  And fortify your self in your decay
  With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
  Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
  And many maiden gardens yet unset,
  With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,
  Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
  So should the lines of life that life repair
  Which this (Time  pencil) or my pupil pen
  Neither in inward worth nor outward fair
  Can make you live your self in eyes of men.
    To give away your self, keeps your self still,
    And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.


                       
  Who will believe my verse in time to come
  If it were filled with your most high deserts?
  Though yet heaven knows it is but astomb
  Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts:  
  Ifcould write the beauty of your eyes,
  And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
  The age to come would say this poet lies,
  Such heavenly touches neeer touched earthly faces.
  So should my papers (yellowed with their age)
  Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,
  And your true rights be termedpoet  rage,
  And stretched metre of an antique song.
    But were some child of yours alive that time,
    You should live twice in it, and in my rhyme.


                         
  Shallcompare thee tosummer  day?
  Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
  Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
  And summer  lease hath all too shortdate:
  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
  And often is his gold complexion dimmed,
  And every fair from fair sometime declines,
  By chance, or nature  changing course untrimmed:  
  But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
  Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow t,
  Nor shall death brag thou wanderest in his shade,
  When in eternal lines to time thou grow t,
    So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
    So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.


                       
  Devouring Time blunt thou the lion  paws,
  And make the earth devour her own sweet brood,
  Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger  jaws,
  And burn the long-lived phoenix, in her blood,
  Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet t,
  And do whateeer thou wilt swift-footed Time
  To the wide world and all her fading sweets:
  Butforbid thee one most heinous crime,
 carve not with thy hours my love  fair brow,
  Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen,
  Him in thy course untainted do allow,
  For beauty  pattern to succeeding men.  
    Yet do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,
    My love shall in my verse ever live young.


                     
 woman  face with nature  own hand painted,
  Hast thou the master mistress of my passion,
 woman  gentle heart but not acquainted
  With shifting change as is false women  fashion,
  An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling:
  Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth,
 man in hue all hues in his controlling,
  Which steals men  eyes and women  souls amazeth.
  And forwoman wert thou first created,
  Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,
  And by addition me of thee defeated,
  By adding one thing to my purpose .
    But since she pricked thee out for women  pleasure,
    Mine be thy love and thy love  use their treasure.


                         
  So is it not with me as with that muse,
  Stirred bypainted beauty to his verse,
  Who heaven it self for ornament doth use,
  And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,
  Makingcouplement of proud compare
  With sun and moon, with earth and sea  rich gems:
  With April  first-born flowers and all things rare,
  That heaven  air in this huge rondure hems.
 let me true in love but truly write,
  And then believe me, my love is as fair,
  As any mother  child, though not so bright
  As those gold candles fixed in heaven  air:
    Let them say more that like of hearsay well,
   will not praise that purpose not to sell.


                     
  My glass shall not persuade meam old,
  So long as youth and thou are of one date,
  But when in thee time  furrowsbehold,
  Then lookdeath my days should expiate.  
  For all that beauty that doth cover thee,
  Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
  Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me,
  How canthen be elder than thou art?
 therefore love be of thyself so wary,
  Asnot for my self, but for thee will,
  Bearing thy heart whichwill keep so chary
  As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.
    Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain,
    Thou gav me thine not to give back again.


                     
  As an unperfect actor on the stage,
  Who with his fear is put beside his part,
  Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
  Whose strength  abundance weakens his own heart;
  Sofor fear of trust, forget to say,
  The perfect ceremony of love  rite,
  And in mine own love  strength seem to decay,
  Oeercharged with burthen of mine own love  might:  
 let my looks be then the eloquence,
  And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
  Who plead for love, and look for recompense,
  More than that tongue that more hath more expressed.
   learn to read what silent love hath writ,
    To hear with eyes belongs to love  fine wit.


                     
  Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled,
  Thy beauty  form in table of my heart,
  My body is the frame wherein etis held,
  And perspective it is best painter  art.
  For through the painter must you see his skill,
  To find where your true image pictured lies,
  Which in my bosom  shop is hanging still,
  That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes:
  Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done,
  Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me
  Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun
  Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;  
    Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,
    They draw but what they see, know not the heart.


                     
  Let those who are in favour with their stars,
  Of public honour and proud titles boast,
  Whilstwhom fortune of such triumph bars
  Unlooked for joy in thathonour most;
  Great princese favourites their fair leaves spread,
  But as the marigold at the sun  eye,
  And in themselves their pride lies buried,
  For atfrown they in their glory die.
  The painful warrior famoused for fight,
  Afterthousand victories once foiled,
  Is from the book of honour razed quite,
  And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:
    Then happythat love and am beloved
    Wheremay not remove nor be removed.


                       
  Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
  Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit;
  To theesend this written embassage
  To witness duty, not to show my wit.
  Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
  May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it;
  But thathope some good conceit of thine
  In thy soul  thought (all naked) will bestow it:
  Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,
  Points on me graciously with fair aspect,
  And puts apparel on my tattered loving,
  To show me worthy of thy sweet respect,
    Then maydare to boast howdo love thee,
    Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.


                     
  Weary with toil,haste me to my bed,
  The dear respose for limbs with travel tired,
  But then beginsjourney in my head
  To work my mind, when body  work  expired.  
  For then my thoughts (from far whereabide)
  Intendzealous pilgrimage to thee,
  And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
  Looking on darkness which the blind do see.
  Save that my soul  imaginary sight
  Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
  Which likejewel (hung in ghastly night)
  Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.
    Lo thus by day my limbs, by night my mind,
    For thee, and for my self, no quiet find.


                       
  How canthen return in happy plight
  That am debarred the benefit of rest?
  When day  oppression is not eased by night,
  But day by night and night by day oppressed.
  And each (though enemies to either  reign)
  Do in consent shake hands to torture me,
  The one by toil, the other to complain
  How fartoil, still farther off from thee.  
 tell the day to please him thou art bright,
  And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:
  So flatterthe swart-complexioned night,
  When sparkling stars twire not thou gild the even.
    But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,
    And night doth nightly make grief  length seem stronger


                     
  When in disgrace with Fortune and men  eyes,
 all alone beweep my outcast state,
  And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
  And look upon my self and curse my fate,
  Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
  Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,
  Desiring this man  art, and that man  scope,
  With whatmost enjoy contented least,
  Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,
  Haplythink on thee, and then my state,
  (Like to the lark at break of day arising
  From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven  gate,  
    For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,
    That thenscorn to change my state with kings.


                     
  When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,
 summon up remembrance of things past,
 sigh the lack of manythingsought,
  And with old woes new wail my dear time  waste:
  Then candrown an eye (unused to flow)
  For precious friends hid in death  dateless night,
  And weep afresh love  long since cancelled woe,
  And moan the expense of manyvanished sight.
  Then cangrieve at grievances foregone,
  And heavily from woe to woe tell oeer
  The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
  Whichnew pay as if not paid before.
    But if the whilethink on thee (dear friend)
    All losses are restored, and sorrows end.


                         
  Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,
  Whichby lacking have supposed dead,
  And there reigns love and all love  loving parts,
  And all those friends whichthought buried.
  How manyholy and obsequious tear
  Hath dear religious love stol en from mine eye,
  As interest of the dead, which now appear,
  But things removed that hidden in thee lie.
  Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
  Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
  Who all their parts of me to thee did give,
  That due of many, now is thine alone.
    Their imagesloved,view in thee,
    And thou (all they) hast all the all of me.


                     
  If thou survive my well-contented day,
  When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover
  And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
  These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover:  
  Compare them with the bettering of the time,
  And though they be outstripped by every pen,
  Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
  Exceeded by the height of happier men.
 then vouchsafe me but this loving thought,
  eHad my friend  Muse grown with this growing age,
 dearer birth than this his love had brought
  To march in ranks of better equipage:
    But since he died and poets better prove,
    Theirs for their style Iell read, his for his lovee.


                     civic
  Full manyglorious morning haveseen,
  Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,
  Kissing with golden face the meadows green;
  Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy:
  Anon permit the basest clouds to ride,
  With ugly rack on his celestial face,
  And from the forlorn world his visage hide
  Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:  
  Even so my sun one early morn did shine,
  With all triumphant splendour on my brow,
  But out alack, he was but one hour mine,
  The region cloud hath masked him from me now.
    Yet him for this, my love no whit disdaineth,
    Suns of the world may stain, when heaven  sun staineth.


                     
  Why didst thou promise suchbeauteous day,
  And make me travel forth without my cloak,
  To let base clouds oeertake me in my way,
  Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?
  eTis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
  To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
  For no man well of suchsalve can speak,
  That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:
  Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief,
  Though thou repent, yethave still the loss,
  The offender  sorrow lends but weak relief
  To him that bears the strong offence  cross.  
    Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
    And they are rich, and ransom all ill deeds.


                     
  No more be grieved at that which thou hast done,
  Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud,
  Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
  And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
  All men make faults, and evenin this,
  Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
  My self corrupting salving thy amiss,
  Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are:
  For to thy sensual faultbring in sense,
  Thy adverse party is thy advocate,
  And egainst my selflawful plea commence:
  Such civil war is in my love and hate,
    Thatan accessary needs must be,
    To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.


                       
  Let me confess that we two must be twain,
  Although our undivided loves are one:
  So shall those blots that do with me remain,
  Without thy help, by me be borne alone.
  In our two loves there is but one respect,
  Though in our livesseparable spite,
  Which though it alter not love  sole effect,
  Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love  delight.
 may not evermore acknowledge thee,
  Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
  Nor thou with public kindness honour me,
  Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
    But do not so,love thee in such sort,
    As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.


                     
  Asdecrepit father takes delight,
  To see his active child do deeds of youth,
  So I, made lame by Fortune  dearest spite
  Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.  
  For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,
  Or any of these all, or all, or more
  Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,
 make my love engrafted to this store:
  So thenam not lame, poor, nor despised,
  Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give,
  Thatin thy abundance am sufficed,
  And bypart of all thy glory live:
    Look what is best, that bestwish in thee,
    This wishhave, then ten times happy me.


                       
  How can my muse want subject to invent
  While thou dost breathe that pour into my verse,
  Thine own sweet argument, too excellent,
  For every vulgar paper to rehearse?
 give thy self the thanks if aught in me,
  Worthy perusal stand against thy sight,
  For who  so dumb that cannot write to thee,
  When thou thy self dost give invention light?  
  Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
  Than those old nine which rhymers invocate,
  And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
  Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
    If my slight muse do please these curious days,
    The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.


                     
 how thy worth with manners maysing,
  When thou art all the better part of me?
  What can mine own praise to mine own self bring:
  And what iset but mine own whenpraise thee?
  Even for this, let us divided live,
  And our dear love lose name of single one,
  That by this separationmay give:
  That due to thee which thou deserv alone:
 absence whattorment wouldst thou prove,
  Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,
  To entertain the time with thoughts of love,
  Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive.  
    And that thou teachest how to make one twain,
    By praising him here who doth hence remain.


                     
  Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all,
  What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
  No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call,
  All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:
  Then if for my love, thou my love receivest,
 cannot blame thee, for my love thou usest,
  But yet be blamed, if thou thy self deceivest
  By wilful taste of what thy self refusest.
 do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
  Although thou steal thee all my poverty:
  And yet love knows it isgreater grief
  To bear greater wrong, than hate  known injury.
    Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
    Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes.


                         
  Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,
  Whenam sometime absent from thy heart,
  Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,
  For still temptation follows where thou art.
  Gentle thou art, and therefore to be won,
  Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed.
  And whenwoman woos, what woman  son,
  Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed?
  Ay me, but yet thou mightst my seat forbear,
  And chide thy beauty, and thy straying youth,
  Who lead thee in their riot even there
  Where thou art forced to breaktwofold truth:
    Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,
    Thine by thy beauty being false to me.


                     
  That thou hast her it is not all my grief,
  And yet it may be saidloved her dearly,
  That she hath thee is of my wailing chief,
 loss in love that touches me more nearly.  
  Loving offenders thuswill excuse ye,
  Thou dost love her, because thou know tlove her,
  And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
  Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.
  Iflose thee, my loss is my love  gain,
  And losing her, my friend hath found that loss,
  Both find each other, andlose both twain,
  And both for my sake lay on me this cross,
    But here  the joy, my friend andare one,
    Sweet flattery, then she loves but me alone.


                     
  When mostwink then do mine eyes best see,
  For all the day they view things unrespected,
  But whensleep, in dreams they look on thee,
  And darkly bright, are bright in dark directed.
  Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
  How would thy shadow  form, form happy show,
  To the clear day with thy much clearer light,
  When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!  
  How would (I say) mine eyes be blessed made,
  By looking on thee in the living day,
  When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade,
  Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!
    All days are nights to see tillsee thee,
    And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.


                     
  If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,
  Injurious distance should not stop my way,
  For then despite of spacewould be brought,
  From limits far remote, where thou dost stay,
  No matter then although my foot did stand
  Upon the farthest earth removed from thee,
  For nimble thought can jump both sea and land,
  As soon as think the place where he would be.
  But ah, thought kills me thatam not thought
  To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,
  But that so much of earth and water wrought,
 must attend, time  leisure with my moan.  
    Receiving nought by elements so slow,
    But heavy tears, badges of either  woe.


                     
  The other two, slight air, and purging fire,
  Are both with thee, whereverabide,
  The first my thought, the other my desire,
  These present-absent with swift motion slide.
  For when these quicker elements are gone
  In tender embassy of love to thee,
  My life being made of four, with two alone,
  Sinks down to death, oppressed with melancholy.
  Until life  composition be recured,
  By those swift messengers returned from thee,
  Who even but now come back again assured,
  Of thy fair health, recounting it to me.
    This told,joy, but then no longer glad,
   send them back again and straight grow sad.


                       
  Mine eye and heart are atmortal war,
  How to divide the conquest of thy sight,
  Mine eye, my heart thy picture  sight would bar,
  My heart, mine eye the freedom of that right,
  My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,
  (  closet never pierced with crystal eyes)
  But the defendant doth that plea deny,
  And says in him thy fair appearance lies.
  To side this title is impanelled
 quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,
  And by their verdict is determined
  The clear eye  moiety, and the dear heart  part.
    As thus, mine eye  due is thy outward part,
    And my heart  right, thy inward love of heart.


                     
  Betwixt mine eye and heartleague is took,
  And each doth good turns now unto the other,
  When that mine eye is famished forlook,
  Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother;  
  With my love  picture then my eye doth feast,
  And to the painted banquet bids my heart:
  Another time mine eye is my heart  guest,
  And in his thoughts of love doth sharepart.
  So either by thy picture or my love,
  Thy self away, art present still with me,
  For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,
  Andam still with them, and they with thee.
    Or if they sleep, thy picture in my sight
    Awakes my heart, to heart  and eye  delight.


                       
  How careful waswhentook my way,
  Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
  That to my use it might unused stay
  From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!
  But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,
  Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,
  Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,
  Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.  
  Thee havenot locked up in any chest,
  Save where thou art not, thoughfeel thou art,
  Within the gentle closure of my breast,
  From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part,
    And even thence thou wilt be stol enfear,
    For truth proves thievish forprize so dear.


                     
  Against that time (if ever that time come)
  Whenshall see thee frown on my defects,
  When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,
  Called to that audit by advised respects,
  Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,
  And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,
  When love converted from the thing it was
  Shall reasons find of settled gravity;
  Against that time doensconce me here
  Within the knowledge of mine own desert,
  And this my hand, against my self uprear,
  To guard the lawful reasons on thy part,  
    To leave poor me, thou hast the strength of laws,
    Since why to love,can allege no cause.


                     
  How heavy dojourney on the way,
  When whatseek (my weary travel  end)
  Doth teach that case and that repose to say
  eThus far the miles are measured from thy friend.e
  The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,
  Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,
  As if by some instinct the wretch did know
  His rider loved not speed being made from thee:
  The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,
  That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,
  Which heavily he answers withgroan,
  More sharp to me than spurring to his side,
    For that same groan doth put this in my mind,
    My grief lies onward and my joy behind.


                         
  Thus can my love excuse the slow offence,
  Of my dull bearer, when from theespeed,
  From where thou art, why shouldhaste me thence?
  Tillreturn of posting is no need.
 what excuse will my poor beast then find,
  When swift extremity can seem but slow?
  Then shouldspur though mounted on the wind,
  In winged speed no motion shallknow,
  Then can no horse with my desire keep pace,
  Therefore desire (of perfect love being made)
  Shall neigh (no dull flesh) in his fiery race,
  But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,
    Since from thee going, he went wilful-slow,
    Towards thee Iell run, and give him leave to go.


                     
  So amas the rich whose blessed key,
  Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,
  The which he will not every hour survey,
  For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.  
  Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,
  Since seldom coming in that long year set,
  Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,
  Or captain jewels in the carcanet.
  So is the time that keeps you as my chest
  Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,
  To make some special instant special-blest,
  By new unfolding his imprisoned pride.
    Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,
    Being had to triumph, being lacked to hope.


                     
  What is your substance, whereof are you made,
  That millions of strange shadows on you tend?
  Since every one, hath every one, one shade,
  And you but one, can every shadow lend:
  Describe Adonis and the counterfeit,
  Is poorly imitated after you,
  On Helen  cheek all art of beauty set,
  And you in Grecian tires are painted new:  
  Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,
  The one doth shadow of your beauty show,
  The other as your bounty doth appear,
  And you in every blessed shape we know.
    In all external grace you have some part,
    But you like none, none you for constant heart.


                     
 how much more doth beauty beauteous seem,
  By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!
  The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
  For that sweet odour, which doth in it live:
  The canker blooms have full as deepdye,
  As the perfumed tincture of the roses,
  Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly,
  When summer  breath their masked buds discloses:
  But for their virtue only is their show,
  They live unwooed, and unrespected fade,
  Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so,
  Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:  
    And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
    When that shall vade, by verse distills your truth.


                     
  Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
  Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,
  But you shall shine more bright in these contents
  Than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time.
  When wasteful war shall statues overturn,
  And broils root out the work of masonry,
  Nor Mars his sword, nor war  quick fire shall burn:
  The living record of your memory.
  eGainst death, and all-oblivious enmity
  Shall you pace forth, your praise shall still find room,
  Even in the eyes of all posterity
  That wear this world out to the ending doom.
    So till the judgment that your self arise,
    You live in this, and dwell in loverse eyes.


                       
  Sweet love renew thy force, be it not said
  Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,
  Which but to-day by feeding is allayed,
  To-morrow sharpened in his former might.
  So love be thou, although to-day thou fill
  Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,
  To-morrow see again, and do not kill
  The spirit of love, withperpetual dulness:
  Let this sad interim like the ocean be
  Which parts the shore, where two contracted new,
  Come daily to the banks, that when they see:
  Return of love, more blest may be the view.
    Or call it winter, which being full of care,
    Makes summer  welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.


                     
  Being your slave what shoulddo but tend,
  Upon the hours, and times of your desire?
 have no precious time at all to spend;
  Nor services to do till you require.  
  Nor darechide the world-without-end hour,
  Whilst(my sovereign) watch the clock for you,
  Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,
  When you have bid your servant once adieu.
  Nor darequestion with my jealous thought,
  Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
  But likesad slave stay and think of nought
  Save where you are, how happy you make those.
    So truefool is love, that in your will,
    (Though you do any thing) he thinks no ill.


                       
  That god forbid, that made me first your slave,
 should in thought control your times of pleasure,
  Or at your hand the account of hours to crave,
  Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure.
 let me suffer (being at your beck)
  The imprisoned absence of your liberty,
  And patience tame to sufferance bide each check,
  Without accusing you of injury.  
  Be where you list, your charter is so strong,
  That you your self may privilage your time
  To what you will, to you it doth belong,
  Your self to pardon of self-doing crime.
   am to wait, though waiting so be hell,
    Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.


                     
  If there be  new, but that which is,
  Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,
  Which labouring for invention bear amis
  The second burthen offormer child!
 that record could withbackward look,
  Even of five hundred courses of the sun,
  Show me your image in some antique book,
  Since mind at first in character was done.
  Thatmight see what the old world could say,
  To this composed wonder of your frame,
  Whether we are mended, or whether better they,
  Or whether revolution be the same.  
   suream the wits of former days,
    To subjects worse have given admiring praise.


                     
  Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,
  So do our minutes hasten to their end,
  Each changing place with that which goes before,
  In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
  Nativity once in the main of light,
  Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crowned,
  Crooked eclipses egainst his glory fight,
  And Time that gave, doth now his gift confound.
  Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth,
  And delves the parallels in beauty  brow,
  Feeds on the rarities of nature  truth,
  And  stands but for his scythe to mow.
    And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand
    Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.


                         
  Is it thy will, thy image should keep open
  My heavy eyelids to the weary night?
  Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,
  While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?
  Is it thy spirit that thou send from thee
  So far from home into my deeds to pry,
  To find out shames and idle hours in me,
  The scope and tenure of thy jealousy?
 no, thy love though much, is not so great,
  It is my love that keeps mine eye awake,
  Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,
  To play the watchman ever for thy sake.
    For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,
    From me far off, with others all too near.


                     
  Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye,
  And all my soul, and all my every part;
  And for this sin there is no remedy,
  It is so grounded inward in my heart.  
  Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,
  No shape so true, no truth of such account,
  And for my self mine own worth do define,
  Asall other in all worths surmount.
  But when my glass shows me my self indeed
  beated and chopt with tanned antiquity,
  Mine own self-love quite contraryread:
  Self, so self-loving were iniquity.
    eTis thee (my self) that for my selfpraise,
    Painting my age with beauty of thy days.


                     
  Against my love shall be asam now
  With Time  injurious hand crushed and oeerworn,
  When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
  With lines and wrinkles, when his youthful morn
  Hath travelled on to age  steepy night,
  And all those beauties whereof now he  king
  Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,
  Stealing away the treasure of his spring:  
  For suchtime donow fortify
  Against confounding age  cruel knife,
  That he shall never cut from memory
  My sweet love  beauty, though my lover  life.
    His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,
    And they shall live, and he in them still green.


                     
  Whenhave seen by Time  fell hand defaced
  The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age,
  When sometime lofty towerssee down-rased,
  And brass eternal slave to mortal rage.
  Whenhave seen the hungry ocean gain
  Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
  And the firm soil win of the watery main,
  Increasing store with loss, and loss with store.
  Whenhave seen such interchange of State,
  Or state it self confounded, to decay,
  Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
  That Time will come and take my love away.  
    This thought is asdeath which cannot choose
    But weep to have, that which it fears to lose.


                     
  Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,
  But sad mortality oeersways their power,
  How with this rage shall beauty holdplea,
  Whose action is no stronger thanflower?
 how shall summer  honey breath hold out,
  Against the wrackful siege of battering days,
  When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
  Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays?
 fearful meditation, where alack,
  Shall Time  best jewel from Time  chest lie hid?
  Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back,
  Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
   none, unless this miracle have might,
    That in black ink my love may still shine bright.


                       
  Tired with all these for restful deathcry,
  As to behold desertbeggar born,
  And needy  trimmed in jollity,
  And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
  And gilded honour shamefully misplaced,
  And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
  And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,
  And strength by limping sway disabled
  And art made tongue-tied by authority,
  And folly (doctor-like) controlling skill,
  And simple truth miscalled simplicity,
  And captive good attending captain ill.
    Tired with all these, from these wouldbe gone,
    Save that to die,leave my love alone.


                     
  Ah wherefore with infection should he live,
  And with his presence grace impiety,
  That sin by him advantage should achieve,
  And lace it self with his society?  
  Why should false painting imitate his cheek,
  And steal dead seeming of his living hue?
  Why should poor beauty indirectly seek,
  Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
  Why should he live, now nature bankrupt is,
  Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins,
  For she hath no exchequer now but his,
  And proud of many, lives upon his gains?
   him she stores, to show what wealth she had,
    In days long since, before these last so bad.


                       
  Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,
  When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,
  Before these bastard signs of fair were born,
  Or durst inhabit onliving brow:
  Before the golden tresses of the dead,
  The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,
  To livesecond life on second head,
  Ere beauty  dead fleece made another gay:  
  In him those holy antique hours are seen,
  Without all ornament, it self and true,
  Making no summer of another  green,
  Robbing no old to dress his beauty new,
    And him as formap doth Nature store,
    To show false Art what beauty was of yore.


                     
  Those parts of thee that the world  eye doth view,
  Want  that the thought of hearts can mend:
  All tongues (the voice of souls) give thee that due,
  Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.
  Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned,
  But those same tongues that give thee so thine own,
  In other accents do this praise confound
  By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.
  They look into the beauty of thy mind,
  And that in guess they measure by thy deeds,
  Then churls their thoughts (although their eyes were kind)
  To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:  
    But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,
    The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.


                     
  That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,
  For slander  mark was ever yet the fair,
  The ornament of beauty is suspect,
 crow that flies in heaven  sweetest air.
  So thou be good, slander doth but approve,
  Thy worth the greater being wooed of time,
  For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
  And thou present tpure unstained prime.
  Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days,
  Either not assailed, or victor being charged,
  Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
  To tie up envy, evermore enlarged,
    If some suspect of ill masked not thy show,
    Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.


                         
  No longer mourn for me whenam dead,
  Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
  Give warning to the world thatam fled
  From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:
  Nay if you read this line, remember not,
  The hand that writ it, forlove you so,
  Thatin your sweet thoughts would be forgot,
  If thinking on me then should make you woe.
 if (I say) you look upon this verse,
  When(perhaps) compounded am with clay,
  Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;
  But let your love even with my life decay.
    Lest the wise world should look into your moan,
    And mock you with me afteram gone.


                     
 lest the world should task you to recite,
  What merit lived in me that you should love
  After my death (dear love) forget me quite,
  For you in me can  worthy prove.  
  Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,
  To do more for me than mine own desert,
  And hang more praise upon deceased I,
  Than niggard truth would willingly impart:
 lest your true love may seem false in this,
  That you for love speak well of me untrue,
  My name be buried where my body is,
  And live no more to shame nor me, nor you.
    Foram shamed by that whichbring forth,
    And so should you, to love things  worth.


                     
  That time of year thou mayst in me behold,
  When yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang
  Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
  Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
  In me thou seest the twilight of such day,
  As after sunset fadeth in the west,
  Which by and by black night doth take away,
  Death  second self that seals up all in rest.  
  In me thou seest the glowing of such fire,
  That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
  As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,
  Consumed with that which it was nourished by.
    This thou perceiv t, which makes thy love more strong,
    To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.


                     
  But be contented when that fell arrest,
  Without all bail shall carry me away,
  My life hath in this line some interest,
  Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.
  When thou reviewest this, thou dost review,
  The very part was consecrate to thee,
  The earth can have but earth, which is his due,
  My spirit is thine the better part of me,
  So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,
  The prey of worms, my body being dead,
  The coward conquest ofwretch  knife,
  Too base of thee to be remembered,  
    The worth of that, is that which it contains,
    And that is this, and this with thee remains.


                     
  So are you to my thoughts as food to life,
  Or as sweet-seasoned showers are to the ground;
  And for the peace of youhold such strife
  As etwixtmiser and his wealth is found.
  Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon
  Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,
  Now counting best to be with you alone,
  Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure,
  Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,
  And by and by clean starved forlook,
  Possessing or pursuing no delight
  Save what is had, or must from you be took.
    Thus dopine and surfeit day by day,
    Or gluttoning on all, or all away.


                       
  Why is my verse so barren of new pride?
  So far from variation or quick change?
  Why with the time donot glance aside
  To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?
  Why writestill all one, ever the same,
  And keep invention innoted weed,
  That every word doth almost tell my name,
  Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?
 know sweet lovealways write of you,
  And you and love are still my argument:
  So all my best is dressing old words new,
  Spending again what is already spent:
    For as the sun is daily new and old,
    So is my love still telling what is told.


                     
  Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,
  Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste,
  These vacant leaves thy mind  imprint will bear,
  And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.  
  The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show,
  Of mouthed graves will give thee memory,
  Thou by thy dial  shady stealth mayst know,
  Time  thievish progress to eternity.
  Look what thy memory cannot contain,
  Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
  Those children nursed, delivered from thy brain,
  To takenew acquaintance of thy mind.
    These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
    Shall profit thee, and much enrich thy book.


                       
  So oft haveinvoked thee for my muse,
  And found such fair assistance in my verse,
  As every alien pen hath got my use,
  And under thee their poesy disperse.
  Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing,
  And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,
  Have added feathers to the learned  wing,
  And given gracedouble majesty.
  Yet be most proud of that whichcompile,
  Whose influence is thine, and born of thee,
  In otherse works thou dost but mend the style,
  And arts with thy sweet graces graced be.
    But thou art all my art, and dost advance
    As high as learning, my rude ignorance.


                     
  Whilstalone did call upon thy aid,
  My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,
  But now my gracious numbers are decayed,
  And my sick muse doth give an other place.
 grant (sweet love) thy lovely argument
  Deserves the travail ofworthier pen,
  Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent,
  He robs thee of, and pays it thee again,
  He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word,
  From thy behaviour, beauty doth he give
  And found it in thy cheek: he can afford
  No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.  
    Then thank him not for that which he doth say,
    Since what he owes thee, thou thy self dost pay.


                       
 howfaint whenof you do write,
  Knowingbetter spirit doth use your name,
  And in the praise thereof spends all his might,
  To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame.
  But since your worth (wide as the ocean is)
  The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,
  My saucy bark (inferior far to his)
  On your broad main doth wilfully appear.
  Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,
  Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride,
  Or (being wrecked)amworthless boat,
  He of tall building, and of goodly pride.
    Then if he thrive andbe cast away,
    The worst was this, my love was my decay.


                           
  Orshall live your epitaph to make,
  Or you survive whenin earth am rotten,
  From hence your memory death cannot take,
  Although in me each part will be forgotten.
  Your name from hence immortal life shall have,
  Though(once gone) to all the world must die,
  The earth can yield me butcommon grave,
  When you entombed in men  eyes shall lie,
  Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
  Which eyes not yet created shall oeer-read,
  And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,
  When all the breathers of this world are dead,
    You still shall live (such virtue hath my pen)
    Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.


                       
 grant thou wert not married to my muse,
  And therefore mayst without attaint oeerlook
  The dedicated words which writers use
  Of their fair subject, blessing every book.  
  Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,
  Finding thy worthlimit past my praise,
  And therefore art enforced to seek anew,
  Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.
  And do so love, yet when they have devised,
  What strained touches rhetoric can lend,
  Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathized,
  In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend.
    And their gross painting might be better used,
    Where cheeks need blood, in thee it is abused.


                       
 never saw that you did painting need,
  And therefore to your fair no painting set,
 found (or thoughtfound) you did exceed,
  That barren tender ofpoet  debt:
  And therefore haveslept in your report,
  That you your self being extant well might show,
  How farmodern quill doth come too short,
  Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.  
  This silence for my sin you did impute,
  Which shall be most my glory being dumb,
  Forimpair not beauty being mute,
  When others would give life, and bringtomb.
    There lives more life in one of your fair eyes,
    Than both your poets can in praise devise.


                       
  Who is it that says most, which can say more,
  Than this rich praise, that you alone, are you?
  In whose confine immured is the store,
  Which should example where your equal grew.
  Lean penury within that pen doth dwell,
  That to his subject lends not some small glory,
  But he that writes of you, if he can tell,
  That you are you, so dignifies his story.
  Let him but copy what in you is writ,
  Not making worse what nature made so clear,
  And suchcounterpart shall fame his wit,
  Making his style admired every where.  
    You to your beauteous blessings addcurse,
    Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.


                       
  My tongue-tied muse in manners holds her still,
  While comments of your praise richly compiled,
  Reserve their character with golden quill,
  And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.
 think good thoughts, whilst other write good words,
  And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen,
  To every hymn that able spirit affords,
  In polished form of well refined pen.
  Hearing you praised,say etis so, etis true,
  And to the most of praise add something more,
  But that is in my thought, whose love to you
  (Though words come hindmost) holds his rank before,
    Then others, for the breath of words respect,
    Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.


                         
  Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
  Bound for the prize of (all too precious) you,
  That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
  Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
  Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,
  Abovemortal pitch, that struck me dead?
  No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
  Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
  He nor that affable familiar ghost
  Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,
  As victors of my silence cannot boast,
 was not sick of any fear from thence.
    But when your countenance filled up his line,
    Then lackedmatter, that enfeebled mine.


                       
  Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
  And like enough thou know thy estimate,
  The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing:
  My bonds in thee are all determinate.  
  For how dohold thee but by thy granting,
  And for that riches where is my deserving?
  The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
  And so my patent back again is swerving.
  Thy self thou gav t, thy own worth then not knowing,
  Or me to whom thou gav it, else mistaking,
  So thy great gift upon misprision growing,
  Comes home again, on better judgement making.
    Thus havehad thee asdream doth flatter,
    In sleepking, but waking no such matter.


                         
  When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,
  And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
  Upon thy side, against my self Iell fight,
  And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn:
  With mine own weakness being best acquainted,
  Upon thy partcan set downstory
  Of faults concealed, whereinam attainted:
  That thou in losing me, shalt win much glory:  
  Andby this will begainer too,
  For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,
  The injuries that to my selfdo,
  Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.
    Such is my love, to theeso belong,
    That for thy right, my self will bear all wrong.


                       
  Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,
  Andwill comment upon that offence,
  Speak of my lameness, andstraight will halt:
  Against thy reasons making no defence.
  Thou canst not (love) disgrace me half so ill,
  To setform upon desired change,
  As Iell my self disgrace, knowing thy will,
 will acquaintance strangle and look strange:
  Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue,
  Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,
  Lest(too much profane) should do it wronk:
  And haply of our old acquaintance tell.  
    For thee, against my self Iell vow debate,
    Formust neeer love him whom thou dost hate.


                     
  Then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now,
  Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
  join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
  And do not drop in for an after-loss:
  Ah do not, when my heart hath  caped this sorrow,
  Come in the rearward ofconquered woe,
  Give notwindy nightrainy morrow,
  To linger outpurposed overthrow.
  If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
  When other petty griefs have done their spite,
  But in the onset come, so shalltaste
  At first the very worst of fortune  might.
    And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,
    Compared with loss of thee, will not seem so.


                         
  Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,
  Some in their wealth, some in their body  force,
  Some in their garments though new-fangled ill:
  Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse.
  And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,
  Wherein it findsjoy above the rest,
  But these particulars are not my measure,
  All thesebetter in one general best.
  Thy love is better than high birth to me,
  Richer than wealth, prouder than garmentse costs,
  Of more delight than hawks and horses be:
  And having thee, of all men  prideboast.
    Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take,
    All this away, and me most wretchcd make.


                     
  But do thy worst to steal thy self away,
  For term of life thou art assured mine,
  And life no longer than thy love will stay,
  For it depends upon that love of thine.  
  Then neednot to fear the worst of wrongs,
  When in the least of them my life hath end,
 see,better state to me belongs
  Than that, which on thy humour doth depend.
  Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,
  Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie,
 whathappy title dofind,
  Happy to have thy love, happy to die!
    But what  so blessed-fair that fears no blot?
    Thou mayst be false, and yetknow it not.


                     
  So shalllive, supposing thou art true,
  Likedeceived husband, so love  face,
  May still seem love to me, though altered new:
  Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place.
  For there can live no hatred in thine eye,
  Therefore in thatcannot know thy change,
  In many  looks, the false heart  history
  Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange.  
  But heaven in thy creation did decree,
  That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell,
  Whateeer thy thoughts, or thy heart  workings be,
  Thy looks should  thence, but sweetness tell.
    How like Eve  apple doth thy beauty grow,
    If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show.


                     
  They that have power to hurt, and will do none,
  That do not do the thing, they most do show,
  Who moving others, are themselves as stone,
  Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow:
  They rightly do inherit heaven  graces,
  And husband nature  riches from expense,
  Tibey are the lords and owners of their faces,
  Others, but stewards of their excellence:
  The summer  flower is to the summer sweet,
  Though to it self, it only live and die,
  But if that flower with base infection meet,
  The basest weed outbraves his dignity:  
    For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,
    Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.


                     
  How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame,
  Which likecanker in the fragrant rose,
  Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!
 in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!
  That tongue that tells the story of thy days,
  (Making lascivious comments on thy sport)
  Cannot dispraise, but inkind of praise,
  Naming thy name, blesses an ill report.
 whatmansion have those vices got,
  Which for their habitation chose out thee,
  Where beauty  veil doth cover every blot,
  And all things turns to fair, that eyes can see!
    Take heed (dear heart) of this large privilege,
    The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.


                       
  Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness,
  Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport,
  Both grace and faults are loved of more and less:
  Thou mak faults graces, that to thee resort:
  As on the finger ofthroned queen,
  The basest jewel will be well esteemed:
  So are those errors that in thee are seen,
  To truths translated, and for true things deemed.
  How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,
  If likelamb he could his looks translate!
  How many gazers mightst thou lead away,
  if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
    But do not so,love thee in such sort,
    As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.


                     
  How likewinter hath my absence been
  From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
  What freezings havefelt, what dark days seen!
  What old December  bareness everywhere!  
  And yet this time removed was summer  time,
  The teeming autumn big with rich increase,
  Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
  Like widowed wombs after their lordse decease:
  Yet this abundant issue seemed to me
  But hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit,
  For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
  And thou away, the very birds are mute.
    Or if they sing, etis with so dullcheer,
    That leaves look pale, dreading the winter  near.


                       
  From you havebeen absent in the spring,
  When proud-pied April (dressed in all his trim)
  Hath putspirit of youth in every thing:
  That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.
  Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell
  Of different flowers in odour and in hue,
  Could make me any summer  story tell:
  Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:  
  Nor didwonder at the lily  white,
  Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose,
  They were but sweet, but figures of delight:
  Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.
    Yet seemed it winter still, and you away,
    As with your shadowwith these did play.


                     
  The forward violet thus didchide,
  Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,
  If not from my love  breath? The purple pride
  Which on thy soft check for complexion dwells,
  In my love  veins thou hast too grossly dyed.
  The lilycondemned for thy hand,
  And buds of marjoram had stol en thy hair,
  The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,
  One blushing shame, another white despair:
 third nor red, nor white, had stol en of both,
  And to his robbery had annexed thy breath,
  But for his theft in pride of all his growth  
 vengeful canker eat him up to death.
    More flowersnoted, yetnone could see,
    But sweet, or colour it had stol en from thee.


                       
  Where art thou Muse that thou forget so long,
  To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?
  Spend thou thy fury on some worthless song,
  Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?
  Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,
  In gentle numbers time so idly spent,
  Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem,
  And gives thy pen both skill and argument.
  Rise resty Muse, my love  sweet face survey,
  If time have any wrinkle graven there,
  If any, besatire to decay,
  And make time  spoils despised everywhere.
    Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,
    So thou prevent his scythe, and crooked knife.

  
                         
 truant Muse what shall be thy amends,
  For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?
  Both truth and beauty on my love depends:
  So dost thou too, and therein dignified:
  Make answer Muse, wilt thou not haply say,
  eTruth needs no colour with his colour fixed,
  Beauty no pencil, beauty  truth to lay:
  But best is best, if never intermixede?
  Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
  Excuse not silence so, foret lies in thee,
  To make him much outlivegilded tomb:
  And to be praised of ages yet to be.
    Then do thy office Muse,teach thee how,
    To make him seem long hence, as he shows now.


                       
  My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming,
 love not less, though less the show appear,
  That love is merchandized, whose rich esteeming,  
  The owner  tongue doth publish every where.
  Our love was new, and then but in the spring,
  Whenwas wont to greet it with my lays,
  As Philomel in summer  front doth sing,
  And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
  Not that the summer is less pleasant now
  Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,
  But that wild music burthens every bough,
  And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
    Therefore like her,sometime hold my tongue:
    Becausewould not dull you with my song.


                       
  Alack what poverty my muse brings forth,
  That having suchscope to show her pride,
  The argument all bare is of more worth
  Than when it hath my added praise beside.
 blame me not ifno more can write!
  Look in your glass and there appearsface,
  That over-goes my blunt invention quite,  
  Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.
  Were it not sinful then striving to mend,
  To mar the subject that before was well?
  For to no other pass my verses tend,
  Than of your graces and your gifts to tell.
    And more, much more than in my verse can sit,
    Your own glass shows you, when you look in it.


                       
  To me fair friend you never can be old,
  For as you were when first your eyeeyed,
  Such seems your beauty still: three winters cold,
  Have from the forests shook three summerse pride,
  Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,
  In process of the seasons haveseen,
  Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,
  Since firstsaw you fresh which yet are green.
  Ah yet doth beauty likedial hand,
  Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived,
  So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand  
  Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived.
    For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred,
    Ere you were born was beauty  summer dead.


                       
  Let not my love be called idolatry,
  Nor my beloved as an idol show,
  Since all alike my songs and praises be
  To one, of one, still such, and ever so.
  Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
  Still constant inwondrous excellence,
  Therefore my verse to constancy confined,
  One thing expressing, leaves out difference.
  Fair, kind, and true, is all my argument,
  Fair, kind, and true, varying to other words,
  And in this change is my invention spent,
  Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.
    Fair, kind, and true, have often lived alone.
    Which three till now, never kept seat in one.

  
                       
  When in the chronicle of wasted time,
 see descriptions of the fairest wights,
  And beauty making beautiful old rhyme,
  In praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights,
  Then in the blazon of sweet beauty  best,
  Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
 see their antique pen would have expressed,
  Even suchbeauty as you master now.
  So all their praises are but prophecies
  Of this our time, all you prefiguring,
  And for they looked but with divining eyes,
  They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
    For we which now behold these present days,
    Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.


                       
  Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul,
  Of the wide world, dreaming on things to come,
  Can yet the lease of my true love control,  
  Supposed as forfeit toconfined doom.
  The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured,
  And the sad augurs mock their own presage,
  Incertainties now crown themselves assured,
  And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
  Now with the drops of this most balmy time,
  My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,
  Since spite of him Iell live in this poor rhyme,
  While he insults oeer dull and speechless tribes.
    And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
    When tyrantse crests and tombs of brass are spent.


                         
  What  in the brain that ink may character,
  Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit,
  What  new to speak, what now to register,
  That may express my love, or thy dear merit?
   sweet boy, but yet like prayers divine,
 must each day say oeer the very same,
  Counting no old thing old, thou mine,thine,  
  Even as when firsthallowed thy fair name.
  So that eternal love in love  fresh case,
  Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
  Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
  But makes antiquity for aye his page,
    Finding the first conceit of love there bred,
    Where time and outward form would show it dead.


                       
 never say thatwas false of heart,
  Though absence seemed my flame to qualify,
  As easy mightfrom my self depart,
  As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:
  That is my home of love, ifhave ranged,
  Like him that travelsreturn again,
  Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,
  So that my self bring water for my stain,
  Never believe though in my nature reigned,
  All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
  That it could so preposterously be stained,  
  To leave for  all thy sum of good:
    For  this wide universecall,
    Save thou my rose, in it thou art my all.


                         
  Alas etis true,have gone here and there,
  And made my selfmotley to the view,
  Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
  Made old offences of affections new.
  Most true it is, thathave looked on truth
  Askance and strangely: but by all above,
  These blenches gave my heart another youth,
  And worse essays proved thee my best of love.
  Now all is done, have what shall have no end,
  Mine appetitenever more will grind
  On newer proof, to try an older friend,
 god in love, to whomam confined.
    Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,
    Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.

  
                           
 for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
  The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,
  That did not better for my life provide,
  Than public means which public manners breeds.
  Thence comes it that my name receivesbrand,
  And almost thence my nature is subdued
  To what it works in, like the dyer  hand:
  Pity me then, and wishwere renewed,
  Whilst likewilling patientwill drink,
  Potions of eisel egainst my strong infection,
  No bitterness thatwill bitter think,
  Nor double penance to correct correction.
    Pity me then dear friend, andassure ye,
    Even that your pity is enough to cure me.


                         
  Your love and pity doth the impression fill,
  Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow,
  For what carewho calls me well or ill,  
  So you oeer-green my bad, my good allow?
  You are my all the world, andmust strive,
  To know my shames and praises from your tongue,
  None else to me, norto none alive,
  That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong.
  In so profound abysmthrow all care
  Of otherse voices, that my adder  sense,
  To critic and to flatterer stopped are:
  Mark how with my neglectdo dispense.
    You are so strongly in my purpose bred,
    That all the world besides methinks are dead.


                         
  Sinceleft you, mine eye is in my mind,
  And that which governs me to go about,
  Doth part his function, and is partly blind,
  Seems seeing, but effectually is out:
  For it no form delivers to the heart
  Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch,
  Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,  
  Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:
  For if it see the rud or gentlest sight,
  The most sweet favour or deformed creature,
  The mountain, or the sea, the day, or night:
  The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.
    Incapable of more, replete with you,
    My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.


                         
  Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you
  Drink up the monarch  plague this flattery?
  Or whether shallsay mine eye saith true,
  And that your love taught it this alchemy?
  To make of monsters, and things indigest,
  Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,
  Creating every badperfect best
  As fast as objects to his beams assemble:
 etis the first, etis flattery in my seeing,
  And my great mind most kingly drinks it up,
  Mine eye well knows what with his gust is egreeing,  
  And to his palate doth prepare the cup.
    If it be poisoned, etis the lesser sin,
    That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.


                         
  Those lines thatbefore have writ do lie,
  Even those that saidcould not love you dearer,
  Yet then my judgment knew no reason why,
  My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer,
  But reckoning time, whose millioned accidents
  Creep in etwixt vows, and change decrees of kings,
  Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp intents,
  Divert strong minds to the course of altering things:
  Alas why fearing of time  tyranny,
  Mightnot then say  enowlove you best,e
  Whenwas certain oeer incertainty,
  Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?
    Love isbabe, then mightnot say so
    To give full growth to that which still doth grow.

  
                         
  Let me not to the marriage of true minds
  Admit impediments, love is not love
  Which alters when it alteration finds,
  Or bends with the remover to remove.
 no, it is an ever-fixed mark
  That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
  It is the star to every wandering bark,
  Whose worth  unknown, although his height be taken.
  Love  not Time  fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
  Within his bending sickle  compass come,
  Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
  But bears it out even to the edge of doom:
    If this be error and upon me proved,
   never writ, nor no man ever loved.


                         
  Accuse me thus, thathave scanted all,
  Whereinshould your great deserts repay,
  Forgot upon your dearest love to call,  
  Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day,
  Thathave frequent been with unknown minds,
  And given to time your own dear-purchased right,
  Thathave hoisted sail to all the winds
  Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
  Book both my wilfulness and errors down,
  And on just proof surmise, accumulate,
  Bring me within the level of your frown,
  But shoot not at me in your wakened hate:
    Since my appeal saysdid strive to prove
    The constancy and virtue of your love.


                           
  Like as to make our appetite more keen
  With eager compounds we our palate urge,
  As to prevent our maladies unseen,
  We sicken to shun sickness when we purge.
  Even so being full of your neeer-cloying sweetness,
  To bitter sauces didframe my feeding;
  And sick of welfare foundkind of meetness,  
  To be diseased ere that there was true needing.
  Thus policy in love te anticipate
  The ills that were not, grew to faults assured,
  And brought to medicinehealthful state
  Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured.
    But thencelearn and find the lesson true,
    Drugs poison him that so feil sick of you.


                         
  What potions havedrunk of Siren tears
  Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within,
  Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,
  Still losing whensaw my self to win!
  What wretched errors hath my heart committed,
  Whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never!
  How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
  In the distraction of this madding fever!
 benefit of ill, nowfind true
  That better is, by evil still made better.
  And ruined love when it is built anew  
  Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.
    Soreturn rebuked to my content,
    And gain by ills thrice more thanhave spent.


                       
  That you were once unkind befriends me now,
  And for that sorrow, whichthen did feel,
  Needs mustunder my transgression bow,
  Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel.
  For if you were by my unkindness shaken
  Asby yours, yehave passedhell of time,
  And Ityrant have no leisure taken
  To weigh how oncesuffered in your crime.
 that our night of woe might have remembered
  My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,
  And soon to you, as you to me then tendered
  The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!
    But that your trespass now becomesfee,
    Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.

  
                         
  eTis better to be vile than vile esteemed,
  When not to be, receives reproach of being,
  And the just pleasure lost, which is so deemed,
  Not by our feeling, but by otherse seeing.
  For why should otherse false adulterate eyes
  Give salutation to my sportive blood?
  Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,
  Which in their wills count bad whatthink good?
  No,am thatam, and they that level
  At my abuses, reckon up their own,
 may be straight though they themselves be bevel;
  By their rank thoughts, my deeds must not be shown
    Unless this general evil they maintain,
    All men are bad and in their badness reign.


                       
  Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain
  Full charactered with lasting memory,
  Which shall above that idle rank remain  
  Beyond all date even to eternity.
  Or at the least, so long as brain and heart
  Have faculty by nature to subsist,
  Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
  Of thee, thy record never can be missed:
  That poor retention could not so much hold,
  Nor needtallies thy dear love to score,
  Therefore to give them from me wasbold,
  To trust those tables that receive thee more:
    To keep an adjunct to remember thee
    Were to import forgetfulness in me.


                       
  No! Time, thou shalt not boast thatdo change,
  Thy pyramids built up with newer might
  To me are  novel,  strange,
  They are but dressings Offormer sight:
  Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire,
  What thou dost foist upon us that is old,
  And rather make them born to our desire,  
  Than think that we before have heard them told:
  Thy registers and theeboth defy,
  Not wondering at the present, nor the past,
  For thy records, and what we see doth lie,
  Made more or less by thy continual haste:
    Thisdo vow and this shall ever be,
   will be true despite thy scythe and thee.


                       
  If my dear love were but the child of state,
  It might for Fortune  bastard be unfathered,
  As subject to time  love or to time  hate,
  Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gathered.
  No it was builded far from accident,
  It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
  Under the blow of thralled discontent,
  Whereto the inviting time our fashion calls:
  It fears not policy that heretic,
  Which works on leases of short-numbered hours,
  But all alone stands hugely politic,  
  That it nor grows with heat, nor drowns with showers.
    To thiswitness call the fools of time,
    Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.


                       
  Wereet aught to mebore the canopy,
  With my extern the outward honouring,
  Or laid great bases for eternity,
  Which proves more short than waste or ruining?
  Havenot seen dwellers on form and favour
  Lose all, and more by paying too much rent
  For compound sweet; forgoing simple savour,
  Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent?
  No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,
  And take thou my oblation, poor but free,
  Which is not mixed with seconds, knows no art,
  But mutual render, only me for thee.
    Hence, thou suborned informer,true soul
    When most impeached, stands least in thy control.

  
                       
 thou my lovely boy who in thy power,
  Dost hold Time  fickle glass his fickle hour:
  Who hast by waning grown, and therein show t,
  Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self grow t.
  If Nature (sovereign mistress over wrack)
  As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,
  She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
  May time disgrace, and wretched minutes kill.
  Yet fear herthou minion of her pleasure,
  She may detain, but not still keep her treasure!
    Her audit (though delayed) answered must be,
    And her quietus is to render thee.


                       
  In the old age black was not counted fair,
  Or if it were it bore not beauty  name:
  But now is black beauty  successive heir,
  And beauty slandered withbastard shame,
  For since each hand hath put on nature  power,  
  Fairing the foul with art  false borrowed face,
  Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower,
  But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.
  Therefore my mistresse eyes are raven black,
  Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem,
  At such who not born fair no beauty lack,
  Slandering creation withfalse esteem,
    Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe,
    That every tongue says beauty should look so.


                         
  How oft when thou, my music, music play t,
  Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
  With thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway t
  The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,
  Doenvy those jacks that nimble leap,
  To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,
  Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap,
  At the wood  boldness by thee blushing stand.
  To be so tickled they would change their state  
  And situation with those dancing chips,
  Oeer whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,
  Making dead wood more blest than living lips,
    Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,
    Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.


                       
  The expense of spirit inwaste of shame
  Is lust in action, and till action, lust
  Is perjured, murderous, bloody full of blame,
  Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,
  Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight,
  Past reason hunted, and no sooner had
  Past reason hated asswallowed bait,
  On purpose laid to make the taker mad.
  Mad in pursuit and in possession so,
  Had, having, and in quest, to have extreme,
 bliss in proof and proved,very woe,
  Beforejoy proposed behinddream.
    All this the world well knows yet none knows well,  
    To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.


                       
  My mistresse eyes are  like the sun,
  Coral is far more red, than her lips red,
  If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun:
  If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head:
 have seen roses damasked, red and white,
  But no such roses seein her cheeks,
  And in some perfumes is there more delight,
  Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
 love to hear her speak, yet wellknow,
  That music hathfar more pleasing sound:
 grantnever sawgoddess go,
  My mistress when she walks treads on the ground.
    And yet by heaventhink my love as rare,
    As any she belied with false compare.


                         
  Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,  
  As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;
  For well thou know to my dear doting heart
  Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.
  Yet in good faith some say that thee behold,
  Thy face hath not the power to make love groan;
  To say they err,dare not be so bold,
  Althoughswear it to my self alone.
  And to be sure that is not falseswear,
 thousand groans but thinking on thy face,
  One on another  neck do witness bear
  Thy black is fairest in my judgment  place.
    In  art thou black save in thy deeds,
    And thence this slander asthink proceeds.


                       
  Thine eyeslove, and they as pitying me,
  Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain,
  Have put on black, and loving mourners be,
  Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.
  And truly not the morning sun of heaven  
  Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,
  Nor that full star that ushers in the even
  Doth half that glory to the sober west
  As those two mourning eyes become thy face:
 let it then as well beseem thy heart
  To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace,
  And suit thy pity like in every part.
    Then willswear beauty herself is black,
    And all they foul that thy complexion lack.


                       civic
  Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
  For that deep wound it gives my friend and me;
  Iset not enough to torture me alone,
  But slave to slavery my sweet friend must be?
  Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken,
  And my next self thou harder hast engrossed,
  Of him, my self, and theeam forsaken,
 torment thrice three-fold thus to be crossed:
  Prison my heart in thy steel bosom  ward,  
  But then my friend  heart let my poor heart bail,
  Whoeeer keeps me, let my heart be his guard,
  Thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol.
    And yet thou wilt, forbeing pent in thee,
    Perforce am thine and all that is in me.


                       
  So nowhave confessed that he is thine,
  Andmy self am mortgaged to thy will,
  My self Iell forfeit, so that other mine,
  Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still:
  But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,
  For thou art covetous, and he is kind,
  He learned but surety-like to write for me,
  Under that bond that him as fist doth bind.
  The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,
  Thou usurer that put forth all to use,
  And suefriend, came debtor for my sake,
  So himlose through my unkind abuse.
    Him havelost, thou hast both him and me,  
    He pays the whole, and yet amnot free.


                       
  Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will,
  And eWille to boot, and eWille in over-plus,
  More than enough amthat vex thee still,
  To thy sweet will making addition thus.
  Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious,
  Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?
  Shall will in others seem right gracious,
  And in my will no fair acceptance shine?
  The sea all water, yet receives rain still,
  And in abundance addeth to his store,
  So thou being rich in will add to thy will
  One will of mine to make thy large will more.
    Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill,
    Think all but one, and me in that one eWill.e


                       
  If thy soul check thee thatcome so near,  
  Swear to thy blind soul thatwas thy eWille,
  And will thy soul knows is admitted there,
  Thus far for love, my love-suit sweet fulfil.
  eWille, will fulfil the treasure of thy love,
  Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one,
  In things of great receipt with case we prove,
  Amongnumber one is reckoned none.
  Then in the number let me pass untold,
  Though in thy store  accountone must be,
  For  hold me, so it please thee hold,
  That  me,something sweet to thee.
    Make but my name thy love, and love that still,
    And then thou lov me for my name is Will.


                       
  Thou blind fool Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,
  That they behold and see not what they see?
  They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
  Yet what the best is, take the worst to be.
  If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks,  
  Be anchored in the bay where all men ride,
  Why of eyese falsehood hast thou forged hooks,
  Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?
  Why should my heart think thatseveral plot,
  Which my heart knows the wide world  common place?
  Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not
  To put fair truth upon so foulface?
    In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,
    And to this false plague are they now transferred.


                         
  When my love swears that she is made of truth,
 do believe her thoughknow she lies,
  That she might think me some untutored youth,
  Unlearned in the world  false subtleties.
  Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
  Although she knows my days are past the best,
  Simplycredit her false-speaking tongue,
  On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed:
  But wherefore says she not she is unjust?  
  And wherefore say notthatam old?
 love  best habit is in seeming trust,
  And age in love, loves not to have years told.
    Thereforelie with her, and she with me,
    And in our faults by lies we flattered be.


                       
 call not me to justify the wrong,
  That thy unkindness lays upon my heart,
  Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue,
  Use power with power, and slay me not by art,
  Tell me thou lov elsewhere; but in my sight,
  Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside,
  What need thou wound with cunning when thy might
  Is more than my oeerpressed defence can bide?
  Let me excuse thee, ah my love well knows,
  Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,
  And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
  That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:
    Yet do not so, but sinceam near slain,  
    Kill me outright with looks, and rid my pain.


                       
  Be wise as thou art cruel, do not press
  My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain:
  Lest sorrow lend me words and words express,
  The manner of my pity-wanting pain.
  Ifmight teach thee wit better it were,
  Though not to love, yet love to tell me so,
  As testy sick men when their deaths be near,
  No news but health from their physicians know.
  For ifshould despairshould grow mad,
  And in my madness might speak ill of thee,
  Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
  Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.
    Thatmay not be so, nor thou belied,
    Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.


                         
  In faithdo not love thee with mine eyes,  
  For they in theethousand errors note,
  But etis my heart that loves what they despise,
  Who in despite of view is pleased to dote.
  Nor are mine cars with thy tongue  tune delighted,
  Nor tender feeling to base touches prone,
  Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
  To any sensual feast with thee alone:
  But my five wits, nor my five senses can
  Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,
  Who leaves unswayed the likeness ofman,
  Thy proud heart  slave and vassal wretch to be:
    Only my plague thus farcount my gain,
    That she that makes me sin, awards me pain.


                       
  Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,
  Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving,
 but with mine, compare thou thine own state,
  And thou shalt find it merits not reproving,
  Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,  
  That have profaned their scarlet ornaments,
  And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,
  Robbed otherse bedse revenues of their rents.
  Be it lawfullove thee as thou lov those,
  Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee,
  Root pity in thy heart that when it grows,
  Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.
    If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,
    By self-example mayst thou be denied.


                       
  Lo ascareful huswife runs to catch,
  One of her feathered creatures broke away,
  Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch
  In pursuit of the thing she would have stay:
  Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,
  Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent,
  To follow that which flies before her face:
  Not prizing her poor infant  discontent;
  So run thou after that which flies from thee,  
  Whilstthy babe chase thee afar behind,
  But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me:
  And play the mother  part, kiss me, be kind.
    So willpray that thou mayst have thy Will,
    If thou turn back and my loud crying still.


                       
  Two loveshave of comfort and despair,
  Which like two spirits do suggest me still,
  The better angel isman right fair:
  The worser spiritwoman coloured ill.
  To win me soon to hell my female evil,
  Tempteth my better angel from my side,
  And would corrupt my saint to bedevil:
  Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
  And whether that my angel be turned fiend,
  Suspectmay, yet not directly tell,
  But being both from me both to each friend,
 guess one angel in another  hell.
    Yet this shallneeer know but live in doubt,  
    Till my bad angel fire my good one out.


                       
  Those lips that Love  own hand did make,
  Breathed forth the sound that said eI hatee,
  To me that languished for her sake:
  But when she saw my woeful state,
  Straight in her heart did mercy come,
  Chiding that tongue that ever sweet,
  Was used in giving gentle doom:
  And taught it thus anew to greet:
  eI hatee she altered with an end,
  That followed it as gentle day,
  Doth follow night who likefiend
  From heaven to hell is flown away.
    eI hatee, from hate away she threw,
    And saved my life saying  enot youe.


                       
  Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth,  
  My sinful earth these rebel powers array,
  Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
  Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
  Why so large cost having so shortlease,
  Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
  Shall worms inheritors of this excess
  Eat up thy charge? is this thy body  end?
  Then soul live thou upon thy servant  loss,
  And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
  Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
  Within be fed, without be rich no more,
    So shall thou feed on death, that feeds on men,
    And death once dead, there  no more dying then.


                       
  My love is asfever longing still,
  For that which longer nurseth the disease,
  Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
  The uncertain sickly appetite to please:
  My reason the physician to my love,  
  Angry that his prescriptions are not kept
  Hath left me, anddesperate now approve,
  Desire is death, which physic did except.
  Past cuream, now reason is past care,
  And frantic-mad with evermore unrest,
  My thoughts and my discourse as mad men  are,
  At random from the truth vainly expressed.
    Forhave sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,
    Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.


                         
 me! what eyes hath love put in my head,
  Which have no correspondence with true sight,
  Or if they have, where is my judgment fled,
  That censures falsely what they see aright?
  If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
  What means the world to say it is not so?
  If it be not, then love doth well denote,
  Love  eye is not so true as all men : no,
  How can it?how can love  eye be true,  
  That is so vexed with watching and with tears?
  No marvel then thoughmistake my view,
  The sun it self sees not, till heaven clears.
   cunning love, with tears thou keep me blind,
    Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.


                       
  Canst thoucruel, saylove thee not,
  Whenagainst my self with thee partake?
  Donot think on thee whenforgot
  Am of my self, all-tyrant, for thy sake?
  Who hateth thee thatdo call my friend,
  On whom frown thou thatdo fawn upon,
  Nay if thou lour on me donot spend
  Revenge upon my self with present moan?
  What merit doin my self respect,
  That is so proud thy service to despise,
  When all my best doth worship thy defect,
  Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?
    But love hate on for nowknow thy mind,  
    Those that can see thou lov t, andam blind.


                       
 from what power hast thou this powerful might,
  With insufficiency my heart to sway,
  To make me give the lie to my true sight,
  And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
  Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
  That in the very refuse of thy deeds,
  There is such strength and warrantise of skill,
  That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds?
  Who taught thee how to make me love thee more,
  The morehear and see just cause of hate?
 thoughlove what others do abhor,
  With others thou shouldst not abhor my state.
    If thy unworthiness raised love in me,
    More worthyto be beloved of thee.


                         
  Love is too young to know what conscience is,  
  Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
  Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss,
  Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove.
  For thou betraying me,do betray
  My nobler part to my gross body  treason,
  My soul doth tell my body that he may,
  Triumph in love, flesh stays no farther reason,
  But rising at thy name doth point out thee,
  As his triumphant prize, proud of this pride,
  He is contented thy poor drudge to be,
  To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.
    No want of conscience hold it thatcall,
    Her love, for whose dear loverise and fall.


                       
  In loving thee thou know tam forsworn,
  But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing,
  In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,
  In vowing new hate after new love bearing:
  But why of two oathse breach doaccuse thee,  
  Whenbreak twenty?am perjured most,
  For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee:
  And all my honest faith in thee is lost.
  Forhave sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness:
  Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,
  And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness,
  Or made them swear against the thing they see.
    Forhave sworn thee fair: more perjured I,
    To swear against the truth so foulbe.


                       
  Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep,
 maid of Dian  this advantage found,
  And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
  Incold valley-fountain of that ground:
  Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love,
 dateless lively heat still to endure,
  And grewseeting bath which yet men prove,
  Against strange maladiessovereign cure:
  But at my mistresse eye Love  brand new-fired,  
  The boy for trial needs would touch my breast,
 sick withal the help of bath desired,
  And thither hiedsad distempered guest.
    But found no cure, the bath for my help lies,
    Where Cupid got new fire; my mistresse eyes.


                       
  The little Love-god lying once asleep,
  Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
  Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep,
  Came tripping by, but in her maiden hand,
  The fairest votary took up that fire,
  Which many legions of true hearts had warmed,
  And so the general of hot desire,
  Was sleeping byvirgin hand disarmed.
  This brand she quenched incool well by,
  Which from Love  fire took heat perpetual,
  Growingbath and healthful remedy,
  For men discased, butmy mistresse thrall,
    Came there for cure and this by thatprove,  
    Love  fire heats water, water cools not love.

SCENE:
Rousillon; Paris; Florence; Marseilles


ACT I. SCENE   .
Rousillon. The COUNT  palace

Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS OF ROUSILLON, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black

  COUNTESS. In delivering my son from me,burysecond husband.
  BERTRAM. Andin going, madam, weep oeer my father  death anew;
    butmust attend his Majesty  command, to whomam now in
    ward, evermore in subjection.
  LAFEU. You shall find of the Kinghusband, madam; you, sir, a
    father. He that so generally is at all times good must of
    necessity hold his virtue to you, whose worthiness would stir it
    up where it wanted, rather than lack it where there is such
    abundance.
  COUNTESS. What hope is there of his Majesty  amendment?
  LAFEU. He hath abandon   his physicians, madam; under whose
    practices he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no other
    advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time.
  COUNTESS. This young gentlewoman hadfather- O, that ehad,e how
    sadpassage etis!-whose skill was almost as great as his
    honesty; had it stretch   so far, would have made nature  
    immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would, for
    the King  sake, he were living!think it would be the death of
    the King  disease.
  LAFEU. How call   you the man you speak of, madam?
  COUNTESS. He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his
    great right to be so- Gerard de Narbon.
  LAFEU. He was excellent indeed, madam; the King very lately spoke
    of him admiringly and mourningly; he was skilful enough to have
    liv   still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.
  BERTRAM. What is it, my good lord, the King languishes of?
  LAFEU.fistula, my lord.
  BERTRAM.heard not of it before.
  LAFEU.would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman the
    daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
  COUNTESS. His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my
    overlooking.have those hopes of her good that her education
    promises; her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts
    fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities,
    there commendations go with pity-they are virtues and traitors
    too. In her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives  
    her honesty, and achieves her goodness.
  LAFEU. Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.
  COUNTESS. eTis the best brinemaiden can season her praise in.
    The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the
    tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. No
    more of this, Helena; go to, no more, lest it be rather thought
    you affectsorrow than to have-
  HELENA.do affectsorrow indeed, buthave it too.
  LAFEU. Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead: excessive
    grief the enemy to the living.
  COUNTESS. If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it
    soon mortal.
  BERTRAM. Madam,desire your holy wishes.
  LAFEU. How understand we that?
  COUNTESS. Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father
    In manners, as in shape! Thy blood and virtue
    Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
    Share with thy birthright! Love all, trustfew,
    Do wrong to none; be able for thine enemy
    Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend  
    Under thy own life  key; be check   for silence,
    But never tax   for speech. What heaven more will,
    That thee may furnish, and my prayers pluck down,
    Fall on thy head! Farewell. My lord,
    eTis an unseason   courtier; good my lord,
    Advise him.
  LAFEU. He cannot want the best
    That shall attend his love.
  COUNTESS. Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.            Exit
  BERTRAM. The best wishes that can be forg   in your thoughts be
    servants to you!  [To HELENA]  Be comfortable to my mother, your
    mistress, and make much of her.
  LAFEU. Farewell, pretty lady; you must hold the credit of your
    father.                             Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU
  HELENA. O, were that all!think not on my father;
    And these great tears grace his remembrance more
    Than thoseshed for him. What was he like?
   have forgot him; my imagination
    Carries no favour inet but Bertram .
   am undone; there is no living, none,  
    If Bertram be away. eTwere all one
    Thatshould lovebright particular star
    And think to wed it, he is so above me.
    In his bright radiance and collateral light
    Mustbe comforted, not in his sphere.
    The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
    The hind that would be mated by the lion
    Must die for love. eTwas pretty, thoughplague,
    To see him every hour; to sit and draw
    His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
    In our heart  table-heart too capable
    Of every line and trick of his sweet favour.
    But now he  gone, and my idolatrous fancy
    Must sanctify his relics. Who comes here?

                       Enter PAROLLES

    [Aside]  One that goes with him.love him for his sake;
    And yetknow himnotorious liar,
    Think himgreat way fool, solelycoward;  
    Yet these fix   evils sit so fit in him
    That they take place when virtue  steely bones
    Looks bleak ie the cold wind; withal, full oft we see
    Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.
  PAROLLES. Save you, fair queen!
  HELENA. And you, monarch!
  PAROLLES. No.
  HELENA. And no.
  PAROLLES. Are you meditating on virginity?
  HELENA. Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you; let me ask you a
    question. Man is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it
    against him?
  PAROLLES. Keep him out.
  HELENA. But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant in the
    defence, yet is weak. Unfold to us some warlike resistance.
  PAROLLES. There is none. Man, setting down before you, will
    undermine you and blow you up.
  HELENA. Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers-up!
    Is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men?
  PAROLLES. Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown  
    up; marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves
     made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth
    of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
    increase; and there was never virgin got till virginity was first
    lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity
    by being once lost may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it
    is ever lost. eTis too coldcompanion; away withet.
  HELENA.will stand for etlittle, though thereforedie a
    virgin.
  PAROLLES. There  little can be said in et; etis against the rule
    of nature. To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your
    mothers; which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs
    himself isvirgin; virginity murders itself, and should be
    buried in highways, out of all sanctified limit, asdesperate
    offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a
    cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with
    feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud,
    idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the
    canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose byet. Out withet.
    Within ten year it will make itself ten, which isgoodly  
    increase; and the principal itself not much the worse. Away
    withet.
  HELENA. How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?
  PAROLLES. Let me see. Marry, ill to like him that neeer it likes.
    eTiscommodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept,
    the less worth. Off withet while etis vendible; answer the time
    of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of
    fashion, richly suited but unsuitable; just like the brooch and
    the toothpick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your
    pie and your porridge than in your cheek. And your virginity,
    your old virginity, is like one of our French wither   pears: it
    looks ill, it eats drily; marry, etiswither   pear; it was
    formerly better; marry, yet etiswither   pear. Will you
    anything with it?
  HELENA. Not my virginity yet.
    There shall your master havethousand loves,
   mother, andmistress, andfriend,
   phoenix, captain, and an enemy,
   guide,goddess, andsovereign,
   counsellor,traitress, anddear;  
    His humble ambition, proud humility,
    His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,
    His faith, his sweet disaster; withworld
    Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms
    That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he-
   know not what he shall. God send him well!
    The court learning-place, and he is one-
  PAROLLES. What one, ie faith?
  HELENA. Thatwish well. eTis pity-
  PAROLLES. What  pity?
  HELENA. That wishing well had notbody inet
    Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,
    Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,
    Might with effects of them follow our friends
    And show what we alone must think, which never
    Returns us thanks.

                      Enter PAGE

  PAGE. Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.      Exit PAGE  
  PAROLLES. Little Helen, farewell; ifcan remember thee,will
    think of thee at court.
  HELENA. Monsieur Parolles, you were born undercharitable star.
  PAROLLES. Under Mars, I.
  HELENA.especially think, under Mars.
  PAROLLES. Why under Man?
  HELENA. The wars hath so kept you under that you must needs be born
    under Mars.
  PAROLLES. When he was predominant.
  HELENA. When he was retrograde,think, rather.
  PAROLLES. Why think you so?
  HELENA. You go so much backward when you fight.
  PAROLLES. That  for advantage.
  HELENA. So is running away, when fear proposes the safety: but the
    composition that your valour and fear makes in you isvirtue of
   good wing, andlike the wear well.
  PAROLLES.am so full of businesscannot answer thee acutely. I
    will return perfect courtier; in the which my instruction shall
    serve to naturalize thee, so thou wilt be capable ofcourtier 
    counsel, and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee; else  
    thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes
    thee away. Farewell. When thou hast leisure, say thy prayers;
    when thou hast none, remember thy friends. Get theegood
    husband and use him as he uses thee. So, farewell.
 Exit
  HELENA. Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
    Which we ascribe to heaven. The fated sky
    Gives us free scope; only doth backward pull
    Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
    What power is it which mounts my love so high,
    That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
    The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
    To join like likes, and kiss like native things.
    Impossible be strange attempts to those
    That weigh their pains in sense, and do suppose
    What hath been cannot be. Who ever strove
    To show her merit that did miss her love?
    The King  disease-my project may deceive me,
    But my intents are fix  , and will not leave me.        Exit




ACT I. SCENE .
Paris. The KING  palace

Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING OF FRANCE, with letters,
and divers ATTENDANTS

  KING. The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;
    Have fought with equal fortune, and continue
   braving war.
  FIRST LORD. So etis reported, sir.
  KING. Nay, etis most credible. We here receive it,
   certainty, vouch   from our cousin Austria,
    With caution, that the Florentine will move us
    For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend
    Prejudicates the business, and would seem
    To have us make denial.
  FIRST LORD. His love and wisdom,
    Approv   so to your Majesty, may plead
    For amplest credence.
  KING. He hath arm   our answer,
    And Florence is denied before he comes;
    Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see  
    The Tuscan service, freely have they leave
    To stand on either part.
  SECOND LORD. It well may serve
   nursery to our gentry, who are sick
    For breathing and exploit.
  KING. What  he comes here?

              Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES

  FIRST LORD. It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,
    Young Bertram.
  KING. Youth, thou bear thy father  face;
    Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
    Hath well compos   thee. Thy father  moral parts
    Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.
  BERTRAM. My thanks and duty are your Majesty .
  KING.wouldhad that corporal soundness now,
    As when thy father and myself in friendship
    First tried our soldiership. He did look far
    Into the service of the time, and was  
    Discipled of the bravest. He lasted long;
    But on us both did haggish age steal on,
    And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
    To talk of your good father. In his youth
    He had the wit whichcan well observe
    To-day in our young lords; but they may jest
    Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
    Ere they can hide their levity in honour.
    So likecourtier, contempt nor bitterness
    Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,
    His equal had awak   them; and his honour,
    Clock to itself, knew the true minute when
    Exception bid him speak, and at this time
    His tongue obey   his hand. Who were below him
    He us   as creatures of another place;
    And bow   his eminent top to their low ranks,
    Making them proud of his humility
    In their poor praise he humbled. Suchman
    Might becopy to these younger times;
    Which, followed well, would demonstrate them now  
    But goers backward.
  BERTRAM. His good remembrance, sir,
    Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;
    So in approof lives not his epitaph
    As in your royal speech.
  KING. Wouldwere with him! He would always say-
    Methinkshear him now; his plausive words
    He scatter   not in ears, but grafted them
    To grow there, and to bear- eLet me not livee-
    This his good melancholy oft began,
    On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
    When it was out-eLet me not livee quoth he
    eAfter my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
    Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
    All but new things disdain; whose judgments are

ACT I. SCENE .
Rousillon. The COUNT  palace

Enter COUNTESS, STEWARD, and CLOWN

  COUNTESS.will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?
  STEWARD. Madam, the carehave had to even your contentwish
    might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours; for then we
    wound our modesty, and make foul the clearness of our deservings,
    when of ourselves we publish them.
  COUNTESS. What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah. The
    complaintshave heard of youdo not all believe; etis my
    slowness thatdo not, forknow you lack not folly to commit
    them and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours.
  CLOWN. eTis not unknown to you, madam,ampoor fellow.
  COUNTESS. Well, sir.
  CLOWN. No, madam, etis not so well thatam poor, though many of
    the rich are damn  ; but ifmay have your ladyship  good will
    to go to the world, Isbel the woman andwill do as we may.
  COUNTESS. Wilt thou needs bebeggar?
  CLOWN.do beg your good will in this case.
  COUNTESS. In what case?  
  CLOWN. In Isbel  case and mine own. Service is no heritage; and I
    thinkshall never have the blessing of God tillhave issue oe
    my body; for they say bames are blessings.
  COUNTESS. Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.
  CLOWN. My poor body, madam, requires it.am driven on by the
    flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.
  COUNTESS. Is this all your worship  reason?
  CLOWN. Faith, madam,have other holy reasons, such as they are.
  COUNTESS. May the world know them?
  CLOWN.have been, madam,wicked creature, as you and all flesh
    and blood are; and, indeed,do marry thatmay repent.
  COUNTESS. Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.
  CLOWN.am out oe friends, madam, andhope to have friends for
    my wife  sake.
  COUNTESS. Such friends are thine enemies, knave.
  CLOWN. Yeare shallow, madam-in great friends; for the knaves come
    to do that for me whicham aweary of. He that ears my land
    spares my team, and gives me leave to in the crop. Ifbe his
    cuckold, he  my drudge. He that comforts my wife is the
    cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh and  
    blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and blood
    is my friend; ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. If men
    could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in
    marriage; for young Charbon the puritan and old Poysam the
    papist, howsomeeer their hearts are sever   in religion, their
    heads are both one; they may jowl horns together like any deer
    ie the herd.
  COUNTESS. Wilt thou ever befoul-mouth   and calumnious knave?
  CLOWN.prophet I, madam; andspeak the truth the next way:

              Forthe ballad will repeat,
                Which men full true shall find:
              Your marriage comes by destiny,
                Your cuckoo sings by kind.

  COUNTESS. Get you gone, sir; Iell talk with you more anon.
  STEWARD. May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to you.
    Of heram to speak.
  COUNTESS. Sirrah, tell my gentlewomanwould speak with her; Helen
   mean.  
  CLOWN.  [Sings]

               eWas this fair face the causee quoth she
                 eWhy the Grecians sacked Troy?
               Fond done, done fond,
                 Was this King Priam  joy?e
               With that she sighed as she stood,
               With that she sighed as she stood,
                 And gave this sentence then:
               eAmong nine bad if one be good,
               Among nine bad if one be good,
                 There  yet one good in ten.e

  COUNTESS. What, one good in ten? You corrupt the song, sirrah.
  CLOWN. One good woman in ten, madam, which ispurifying oe the
    song. Would God would serve the world so all the year! We   find
    no fault with the tithe-woman, ifwere the parson. One in ten,
    quoth ea! An we might havegood woman born before every blazing
    star, or at an earthquake, etwould mend the lottery well:man
    may draw his heart out ere ea pluck one.
  COUNTESS. Youell be gone, sir knave, and do ascommand you.  
  CLOWN. That man should be at woman  command, and yet no hurt done!
    Though honesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will
    wear the surplice of humility over the black gown ofbig heart.
   am going, forsooth. The business is for Helen to come hither.
 Exit
  COUNTESS. Well, now.
  STEWARD.know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.
  COUNTESS. Faithdo. Her father bequeath   her to me; and she
    herself, without other advantage, may lawfully make title to as
    much love as she finds. There is more owing her than is paid; and
    more shall be paid her than sheell demand.
  STEWARD. Madam,was very late more near her thanthink she
    wish   me. Alone she was, and did communicate to herself her own
    words to her own ears; she thought,dare vow for her, they
    touch   not any stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your
    son. Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such
    difference betwixt their two estates; Love no god, that would not
    extend his might only where qualities were level; Diana no queen
    of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surpris   without
    rescue in the first assault, or ransom afterward. This she  
    deliver   in the most bitter touch of sorrow that eeerheard
    virgin exclaim in; whichheld my duty speedily to acquaint you
    withal; sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you
    something to know it.
  COUNTESS. YOU have discharg   this honestly; keep it to yourself.
    Many likelihoods inform   me of this before, which hung so
    tottering in the balance thatcould neither believe nor
    misdoubt. Pray you leave me. Stall this in your bosom; and I
    thank you for your honest care.will speak with you further
    anon.                                           Exit STEWARD

    Even so it was with me whenwas young.
    If ever we are nature , these are ours; this thorn
    Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;
    Our blood to us, this to our blood is born.
    It is the show and seal of nature  truth,
    Where love  strong passion is impress   in youth.
    By our remembrances of days foregone,  
    Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.
    Her eye is sick onet;observe her now.
  HELENA. What is your pleasure, madam?
  COUNTESS. You know, Helen,
   ammother to you.
  HELENA. Mine honourable mistress.
  COUNTESS. Nay,mother.
    Why notmother? Whensaid ea mother,e
    Methought you sawserpent. What  in emothere
    That you start at it?sayam your mother,
    And put you in the catalogue of those
    That were enwombed mine. eTis often seen
    Adoption strives with nature, and choice breeds
   native slip to us from foreign seeds.
    You neeer oppress   me withmother  groan,
    Yetexpress to youmother  care.
    God  mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood
    To sayam thy mother? What  the matter,
    That this distempered messenger of wet,
    The many-colour   Iris, rounds thine eye?  
    Why, that you are my daughter?
  HELENA. Thatam not.
  COUNTESS.sayam your mother.
  HELENA. Pardon, madam.
    The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:
   am from humble, he from honoured name;
    No note upon my parents, his all noble.
    My master, my dear lord he is; and I
    His servant live, and will his vassal die.
    He must not be my brother.
  COUNTESS. Noryour mother?
  HELENA. You are my mother, madam; would you were-
    So that my lord your son were not my brother-
    Indeed my mother! Or were you both our mothers,
   care no more for thando for heaven,
    Sowere not his sister. Canet no other,
    But,your daughter, he must be my brother?
  COUNTESS. Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law.
    God shield you mean it not!   aughtere and emothere
    So strive upon your pulse. What! pale again?  
    My fear hath catch   your fondness. Nowsee
    The mystery of your loneliness, and find
    Your salt tearse head. Now to all sense etis gross
    You love my son; invention is asham  ,
    Against the proclamation of thy passion,
    To say thou dost not. Therefore tell me true;
    But tell me then, etis so; for, look, thy cheeks
    Confess it, the one to the other; and thine eyes
    See it so grossly shown in thy behaviours
    That in their kind they speak it; only sin
    And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,
    That truth should be suspected. Speak, iset so?
    If it be so, you have woundgoodly clew;
    If it be not, forswearet; howeeer,charge thee,
    As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,
    To tell me truly.
  HELENA. Good madam, pardon me.
  COUNTESS. Do you love my son?
  HELENA. Your pardon, noble mistress.
  COUNTESS. Love you my son?  
  HELENA. Do not you love him, madam?
  COUNTESS. Go not about; my love hath inetbond
    Whereof the world takes note. Come, come, disclose
    The state of your affection; for your passions
    Have to the full appeach  .
  HELENA. Thenconfess,
    Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,
    That before you, and next unto high heaven,
   love your son.
    My friends were poor, but honest; so  my love.
    Be not offended, for it hurts not him
    That he is lov   of me;follow him not
    By any token of presumptuous suit,
    Nor wouldhave him tilldo deserve him;
    Yet never know how that desert should be.
   knowlove in vain, strive against hope;
    Yet in this captious and intenible sieve
   still pour in the waters of my love,
    And lack not to lose still. Thus, Indian-like,
    Religious in mine error,adore  
    The sun that looks upon his worshipper
    But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,
    Let not your hate encounter with my love,
    For loving where you do; but if yourself,
    Whose aged honour citesvirtuous youth,
    Did ever in so trueflame of liking
    Wish chastely and love dearly that your Dian
    Was both herself and Love; O, then, give pity
    To her whose state is such that cannot choose
    But lend and give where she is sure to lose;
    That seeks not to find that her search implies,
    But, riddle-like, lives sweetly where she dies!
  COUNTESS. Had you not lately an intent-speak truly-
    To go to Paris?
  HELENA. Madam,had.
  COUNTESS. Wherefore? Tell true.
  HELENA.will tell truth; by grace itselfswear.
    You know my father left me some prescriptions
    Of rare and prov   effects, such as his reading
    And manifest experience had collected  
    For general sovereignty; and that he will   me
    In heedfull reservation to bestow them,
    As notes whose faculties inclusive were
    More than they were in note. Amongst the rest
    There isremedy, approv  , set down,
    To cure the desperate languishings whereof
    The King is render   lost.
  COUNTESS. This was your motive
    For Paris, was it? Speak.
  HELENA. My lord your son made me to think of this,
    Else Paris, and the medicine, and the King,
    Had from the conversation of my thoughts
    Haply been absent then.
  COUNTESS. But think you, Helen,
    If you should tender your supposed aid,
    He would receive it? He and his physicians
    Are ofmind: he, that they cannot help him;
    They, that they cannot help. How shall they credit
   poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
    Embowell   of their doctrine, have let off  
    The danger to itself?
  HELENA. There  something inet
    More than my father  skill, which was the great t
    Of his profession, that his good receipt
    Shall for my legacy be sanctified
    By the luckiest stars in heaven; and, would your honour
    But give me leave to try success,   venture
    The well-lost life of mine on his Grace  cure.
    By suchday and hour.
  COUNTESS. Dost thou believeet?
  HELENA. Ay, madam, knowingly.
  COUNTESS. Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,
    Means and attendants, and my loving greetings
    To those of mine in court. Iell stay at home,
    And pray God  blessing into thy attempt.
    Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,
    Whatcan help thee to thou shalt not miss.          Exeunt

ACT   . SCENE   .
Paris. The KING  palace

Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING with divers young LORDS taking leave
for the Florentine war; BERTRAM and PAROLLES; ATTENDANTS

  KING. Farewell, young lords; these war-like principles
    Do not throw from you. And you, my lords, farewell;
    Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain all,
    The gift doth stretch itself as etis receiv  ,
    And is enough for both.
  FIRST LORD. eTis our hope, sir,
    After well-entered soldiers, to return
    And find your Grace in health.
  KING. No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart
    Will not confess he owes the malady
    That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;
    Whetherlive or die, be you the sons
    Of worthy Frenchmen; let higher Italy-
    Those bated that inherit but the fall
    Of the last monarchy-see that you come  
    Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when
    The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,
    That fame may cry you aloud.say farewell.
  SECOND LORD. Health, at your bidding, serve your Majesty!
  KING. Those girls of Italy, take heed of them;
    They say our French lack language to deny,
    If they demand; beware of being captives
    Before you serve.
    BOTH. Our hearts receive your warnings.
  KING. Farewell.  [To ATTENDANTS]  Come hither to me.
                                       The KING retires attended
  FIRST LORD.my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!

  BERTRAM.shall stay here the forehorse tosmock,
    Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,  
    Till honour be bought up, and no sword worn

  PAROLLES. Commit it, Count.
  SECOND LORD.am your accessary; and so farewell.

  FIRST LORD. Farewell, Captain.
  SECOND LORD. Sweet Monsieur Parolles!
  PAROLLES. Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good sparks and
    lustrous,word, good metals: you shall find in the regiment of
    the Spin  one Captain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of
    war, here on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword

  FIRST LORD. We shall, noble Captain.
  PAROLLES. Mars dote on you for his novices!       Exeunt LORDS
    What will ye do?

                            Re-enter the KING

  BERTRAM. Stay; the King!  
  PAROLLES. Usemore spacious ceremony to the noble lords; you have
    restrain   yourself within the list of too cold an adieu. Be more
    expressive to them; for they wear themselves in the cap of the
    time; there do muster true gait; eat, speak, and move, under the
    influence of the most receiv   star; and though the devil lead
    the measure, such are to be followed. After them, and takemore
    dilated farewell.
  BERTRAM. Andwill do so.
  PAROLLES. Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.
                                     Exeunt BERTRAM and PAROLLES

                              Enter LAFEU

  LAFEU.  [Kneeling]  Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.
  KING. Iell fee thee to stand up.
  LAFEU. Then here man stands that has brought his pardon.
   would you had kneel  , my lord, to ask me mercy;
    And that at my bidding you could so stand up.
  KING.wouldhad; sohad broke thy pate,
    And ask   thee mercy foret.  
  LAFEU. Good faith, across!
    But, my good lord, etis thus: will you be cur  
    Of your infirmity?
  KING. No.
  LAFEU. O, will you eat
    No grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you will
    My noble grapes, an if my royal fox
    Could reach them:have seenmedicine
    That  able to breathe life intostone,
    Quickenrock, and make you dance canary
    With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch
    Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,
    To give great Charlemainpen in  hand
    And write to herlove-line.
  KING. What her is this?
  LAFEU. Why, Doctor She! My lord, there  one arriv  ,
    If you will see her. Now, by my faith and honour,
    If seriouslymay convey my thoughts
    In this my light deliverance,have spoke
    With one that in her sex, her years, profession,  
    Wisdom, and constancy, hath amaz   me more
    Thandare blame my weakness. Will you see her,
    For that is her demand, and know her business?
    That done, laugh well at me.
  KING. Now, good Lafeu,
    Bring in the admiration, that we with the
    May spend our wonder too, or take off thine
    By wondering how thou took it.
  LAFEU. Nay, Iell fit you,
    And not be all day neither.                       Exit LAFEU
  KING. Thus he his special  ever prologues.

                   Re-enter LAFEU with HELENA

  LAFEU. Nay, come your ways.
  KING. This haste hath wings indeed.
  LAFEU. Nay, come your ways;
    This is his Majesty; say your mind to him.
   traitor you do look like; but such traitors
    His Majesty seldom fears.am Cressid  uncle,  
    That dare leave two together. Fare you well.            Exit
  KING. Now, fair one, does your business follow us?
  HELENA. Ay, my good lord.
    Gerard de Narbon was my father,
    In what he did profess, well found.
  KING.knew him.
  HELENA. The rather willspare my praises towards him;
    Knowing him is enough. On  bed of death
    Many receipts he gave me; chiefly one,
    Which, as the dearest issue of his practice,
    And of his old experience the only darling,
    He bade me store up astriple eye,
    Safer than mine own two, more dear.have so:
    And, hearing your high Majesty is touch  
    With that malignant cause wherein the honour
    Of my dear father  gift stands chief in power,
   come to tender it, and my appliance,
    With all bound humbleness.
  KING. We thank you, maiden;
    But may not be so credulous of cure,  
    When our most learned doctors leave us, and
    The congregated college have concluded
    That labouring art can never ransom nature
    From her inaidable estate-I say we must not
    So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,
    To prostitute our past-cure malady
    To empirics; or to dissever so
    Our great self and our credit to esteem
   senseless help, when help past sense we deem.
  HELENA. My duty then shall pay me for my pains.
   will no more enforce mine office on you;
    Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
   modest one to bear me back again.
  KING.cannot give thee less, to be call   grateful.
    Thou thought to help me; and such thanksgive
    As one near death to those that wish him live.
    But what at fullknow, thou know no part;
   knowing all my peril, thou no art.
  HELENA. Whatcan do can do no hurt to try,
    Since you set up your rest egainst remedy.  
    He that of greatest works is finisher
    Oft does them by the weakest minister.
    So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,
    When judges have been babes. Great floods have flown
    From simple sources, and great seas have dried
    When miracles have by the greatest been denied.
    Oft expectation fails, and most oft there
    Where most it promises; and oft it hits
    Where hope is coldest, and despair most fits.
  KING.must not hear thee. Fare thee well, kind maid;
    Thy pains, not us  , must by thyself be paid;
    Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.
  HELENA. Inspired merit so by breath is barr  .
    It is not so with Him that all things knows,
    As etis with us that square our guess by shows;
    But most it is presumption in us when
    The help of heaven we count the act of men.
    Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;
    Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.
   am not an impostor, that proclaim  
    Myself against the level of mine aim;
    But knowthink, and thinkknow most sure,
    My art is not past power nor you past cure.
  KING. Art thou so confident? Within what space
    Hop thou my cure?
  HELENA. The greatest Grace lending grace.
    Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
    Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,
    Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
    Moist Hesperus hath quench   his sleepy lamp,
    Or four and twenty times the pilot  glass
    Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
    What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,
    Health shall live free, and sickness freely die.
  KING. Upon thy certainty and confidence
    What dar thou venture?
  HELENA. Tax of impudence,
   strumpet  boldness,divulged shame,
    Traduc   by odious ballads; my maiden  name
    Sear   otherwise; ne worse of worst-extended  
    With vilest torture let my life be ended.
  KING. Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
    His powerful sound within an organ weak;
    And what impossibility would slay
    In common sense, sense saves another way.
    Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate
    Worth name of life in thee hath estimate:
    Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all
    That happiness and prime can happy call.
    Thou this to hazard needs must intimate
    Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.
    Sweet practiser, thy physicwill try,
    That ministers thine own death ifdie.
  HELENA. Ifbreak time, or flinch in property
    Of whatspoke, unpitied let me die;
    And well deserv  . Not helping, death  my fee;
    But, ifhelp, what do you promise me?
  KING. Make thy demand.
  HELENA. But will you make it even?
  KING. Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.  
  HELENA. Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
    What husband in thy powerwill command.
    Exempted be from me the arrogance
    To choose from forth the royal blood of France,
    My low and humble name to propagate
    With any branch or image of thy state;
    But suchone, thy vassal, whomknow
    Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.
  KING. Here is my hand; the premises observ  ,
    Thy will by my performance shall be serv  .
    So make the choice of thy own time, for I,
    Thy resolv   patient, on thee still rely.
    More shouldquestion thee, and moremust,
    Though more to know could not be more to trust,
    From whence thou cam t, how tended on. But rest
    Unquestion   welcome and undoubted blest.
    Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed
    As high as word, my deed shall match thy deed.

  LAFEU. They say miracles are past; and we have our philosophical
    persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and
    causeless. Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors,
    ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit
    ourselves to an unknown fear.

    Fair maid, send forth thine eye. This youthful parcel
    Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,  
    Oeer whom both sovereign power and father  voice
   have to use. Thy frank election make;
    Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.
  HELENA. To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
    Fall, when love please. Marry, to each but one!
  LAFEU.   give bay Curtal and his furniture
    My mouth no more were broken than these boyse,
    And writ as little beard.
  KING. Peruse them well.
    Not one of those but hadnoble father.
  HELENA. Gentlemen,
    Heaven hath through me restor   the King to health.
  ALL. We understand it, and thank heaven for you.
  HELENA.amsimple maid, and therein wealthiest
    Thatprotestsimply ammaid.
    Please it your Majesty,have done already.
    The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me:
    eWe blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,
    Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever,
    Weell neeer come there again.e  
  KING. Make choice and see:
    Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.
  HELENA. Now, Dian, from thy altar dofly,
    And to imperial Love, that god most high,
    Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?
  FIRST LORD. And grant it.
  HELENA. Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.
  LAFEU.had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace for my
    life.
  HELENA. The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,
    Beforespeak, too threat eningly replies.
    Love make your fortunes twenty times above
    Her that so wishes, and her humble love!
  SECOND LORD. No better, if you please.
  HELENA. My wish receive,
    Which great Love grant; and sotake my leave.
  LAFEU. Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine   have
    them whipt; orwould send them to the Turk to make eunuchs of.
  HELENA. Be not afraid thatyour hand should take;
    Iell never do you wrong for your own sake.  
    Blessing upon your vows; and in your bed
    Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!
  LAFEU. These boys are boys of ice; theyell none have her.
    Sure, they are bastards to the English; the French neeer got eem.
  HELENA. You are too young, too happy, and too good,
    To make yourselfson out of my blood.
  FOURTH LORD. Fair one,think not so.
  LAFEU. There  one grape yet;am sure thy father drunk wine-but
    if thou be not an ass,amyouth of fourteen;have known
    thee already.
  HELENA.  [To BERTRAM] dare not saytake you; butgive
    Me and my service, ever whilstlive,
    Into your guiding power. This is the man.
  KING. Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she  thy wife.
  BERTRAM. My wife, my liege!shall beseech your Highness,
    In suchbusiness give me leave to use
    The help of mine own eyes.
  KING. Know thou not, Bertram,
    What she has done for me?
  BERTRAM. Yes, my good lord;  
    But never hope to know whyshould marry her.
  KING. Thou know she has rais   me from my sickly bed.
  BERTRAM. But follows it, my lord, to bring me down
    Must answer for your raising?know her well:
    She had her breeding at my father  charge.
   poor physician  daughter my wife! Disdain
    Rather corrupt me ever!
  KING. eTis only title thou disdain in her, the which
   can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,
    Of colour, weight, and heat, pour   all together,
    Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off
    In differences so mighty. If she be
    All that is virtuous-save what thou dislik t,
   poor physician  daughter-thou dislik t
    Of virtue for the name; but do not so.
    From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,
    The place is dignified by the doer  deed;
    Where great additions swell , and virtue none,
    It isdropsied honour. Good alone
    Is good withoutname. Vileness is so:  
    The property by what it is should go,
    Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;
    In these to nature she  immediate heir;
    And these breed honour. That is honour  scorn
    Which challenges itself as honour  born
    And is not like the sire. Honours thrive
    When rather from our acts we them derive
    Than our fore-goers. The mere word slave,
    Debauch   on every tomb, on every grave
   lying trophy; and as oft is dumb
    Where dust and damn   oblivion is the tomb
    Of honour   bones indeed. What should be said?
    If thou canst like this creature asmaid,
   can create the rest. Virtue and she
    Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.
  BERTRAM.cannot love her, nor will strive to do et.
  KING. Thou wrong thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.
  HELENA. That you are well restor  , my lord, Iem glad.
    Let the rest go.
  KING. My honour  at the stake; which to defeat,  
   must produce my power. Here, take her hand,
    Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift,
    That dost in vile misprision shackle up
    My love and her desert; that canst not dream
    We, poising us in her defective scale,
    Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know
    It is in us to plant thine honour where
    We please to have it grow. Check thy contempt;
    Obey our will, which travails in thy good;
    Believe not thy disdain, but presently
    Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
    Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;
    Orwill throw thee from my care for ever
    Into the staggers and the careless lapse
    Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate
    Loosing upon thee in the name of justice,
    Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.
  BERTRAM. Pardon, my gracious lord; forsubmit
    My fancy to your eyes. Whenconsider
    What great creation and what dole of honour  
    Flies where you bid it,find that she which late
    Was in my nobler thoughts most base is now
    The praised of the King; who, so ennobled,
    Is as etwere born so.
  KING. Take her by the hand,
    And tell her she is thine; to whompromise
   counterpoise, if not to thy estate
   balance more replete.
  BERTRAM.take her hand.
  KING. Good fortune and the favour of the King
    Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony
    Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,
    And be perform   to-night. The solemn feast
    Shall more attend upon the coming space,
    Expecting absent friends. As thou lov her,
    Thy love  to me religious; else, does err.

  PAROLLES. Recantation! My Lord! my master!
  LAFEU. Ay; is it notlanguagespeak?
  PAROLLES.most harsh one, and not to be understood without bloody
    succeeding. My master!
  LAFEU. Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?
  PAROLLES. To any count; to all counts; to what is man.
  LAFEU. To what is count  man: count  master is of another style.
  PAROLLES. You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too
    old.
  LAFEU.must tell thee, sirrah,write man; to which title age
    cannot bring thee.
  PAROLLES. Whatdare too well do,dare not do.
  LAFEU.did think thee, for two ordinaries, to bepretty wise
    fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel; it might
    pass. Yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly
    dissuade me from believing theevessel of too greatburden. I
    have now found thee; whenlose thee againcare not; yet art
    thou good for  but taking up; and that thouert scarce
    worth.  
  PAROLLES. Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee-
  LAFEU. Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou hasten thy
    trial; which if-Lord have mercy on thee forhen! So, my good
    window of lattice, fare thee well; thy casementneed not open,
    forlook through thee. Give me thy hand.
  PAROLLES. My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.
  LAFEU. Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.
  PAROLLES.have not, my lord, deserv   it.
  LAFEU. Yes, good faith, every dram of it; andwill not bate thee

  PAROLLES. Well,shall be wiser.
  LAFEU. Ev en as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull atsmack
    oe the contrary. If ever thou be bound in thy scarf and
    beaten, thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage. I
    havedesire to hold my acquaintance with thee, or rather my
    knowledge, thatmay say in the default   ismanknow.e
  PAROLLES. My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.
  LAFEU.would it were hell pains for thy sake, and my poor doing

  PAROLLES. Well, thou hastson shall take this disgrace off me:
    scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well,must be patient; there
    is no fettering of authority. Iell beat him, by my life, ifcan
    meet him with any convenience, an he were double and double a
    lord. Iell have no more pity of his age thanwould have of-
    Iell beat him, and ifcould but meet him again.

  LAFEU. Sirrah, your lord and master  married; there  news for
    you; you havenew mistress.
  PAROLLES.most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some
    reservation of your wrongs. He is my good lord: whomserve
    above is my master.
  LAFEU. Who? God?
  PAROLLES. Ay, sir.
  LAFEU. The devil it is that  thy master. Why dost thou garter up
    thy arms oe this fashion? Dost make hose of thy sleeves? Do other
    servants so? Thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose
    stands. By mine honour, ifwere but two hours younger,   beat  
    thee. Methink thou artgeneral offence, and every man should
    beat thee.think thou wast created for men to breathe
    themselves upon thee.
  PAROLLES. This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.
  LAFEU. Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for pickingkernel
    out ofpomegranate; you arevagabond, and no true traveller;
    you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the
    commission of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are
    not worth another word, else   call you knave.leave you.

  BERTRAM. Although before the solemn priesthave sworn,
   will not bed her.
  PAROLLES. What, what, sweetheart?  
  BERTRAM.my Parolles, they have married me!
    Iell to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.
  PAROLLES. France isdog-hole, and it no more merits
    The tread ofman  foot. To the wars!
  BERTRAM. There  letters from my mother; what the import isknow
    not yet.
  PAROLLES. Ay, that would be known. To the wars, my boy, to the
      wars!
    He wears his honour inbox unseen
    That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,
    Spending his manly marrow in her arms,
    Which should sustain the bound and high curvet
    Of Mars  fiery steed. To other regions!
    France isstable; we that dwell inet jades;
    Therefore, to the war!
  BERTRAM. It shall be so; Iell send her to my house,
    Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,
    And wherefoream fled; write to the King
    That whichdurst not speak. His present gift
    Shall furnish me to those Italian fields  
    Where noble fellows strike. War is no strife
    To the dark house and the detested wife.
  PAROLLES. Will this capriccio hold in thee, art sure?
  BERTRAM. Go with me to my chamber and advise me.
    Iell send her straight away. To-morrow
    Iell to the wars, she to her single sorrow.
  PAROLLES. Why, these balls bound; there  noise in it. eTis hard:

    Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go.

  HELENA. If she be very well, what does she ail that she  not very

  CLOWN. Truly, she  very well indeed, but for two things.

    My dearest master, your dear son, may hie.

    His taken labours bid him me forgive;
    I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth
    From courtly friends, with camping foes to live,
    Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth.
    He is too good and fair for death and me;
    Whommyself embrace to set him free.e  
  COUNTESS. Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!
    Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much
    As letting her pass so; hadspoke with her,

  COUNTESS. What angel shall
    Bless this unworthy husband? He cannot thrive,
    Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear
    And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
    Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,
    To this unworthy husband of his wife;
    Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
    That he does weigh too light. My greatest grief,
    Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.

    When haply he shall hear that she is gone  
    He will return; and hopemay that she,
    Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,

  SECOND LORD. On my life, my lord,bubble.
  BERTRAM. Do you thinkam so far deceived in him?
  SECOND LORD. Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,

    most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly
    promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your
    lordship  entertainment.
  FIRST LORD. It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in his
    virtue, which he hath not, he might at some great and trusty
    business inmain danger fail you.
  BERTRAM.wouldknew in what particular action to try him.
  FIRST LORD. None better than to let him fetch off his drum, which
    you hear him so confidently undertake to do.
  SECOND LORD.withtroop of Florentines will suddenly surprise  
    him; suchwill have whomam sure he knows not from the enemy.
    We will bind and hoodwink him so that he shall suppose no other
    but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when
    we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship present at
    his examination; if he do not, for the promise of his life and in
    the highest compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you and
    deliver all the intelligence in his power against you, and that
    with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never trust my
    judgment in anything.
  FIRST LORD. O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum; he
    says he hasstratagem foret. When your lordship sees the bottom
    of his success inet, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of
    ore will be melted, if you give him not John Drum 
    entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed. Here he comes.

  SECOND LORD. O, for the love of laughter, hinder not the honour of

  FIRST LORD.pox on et; let it go; etis butdrum.
  PAROLLES. Butdrum! Iset butdrum?drum so lost! There was
    excellent command: to charge in with our horse upon our own
    wings, and to rend our own soldiers!
  FIRST LORD. That was not to be blam   in the command of the
    service; it wasdisaster of war that Caesar himself could not
    have prevented, if he had been there to command.
  BERTRAM. Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success.
    Some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is not to
    be recovered.
  PAROLLES. It might have been recovered.
  BERTRAM. It might, but it is not now.
  PAROLLES. It is to be recovered. But that the merit of service is
    seldom attributed to the true and exact performer,would have
    that drum or another, or ehic jacet.e
  BERTRAM. Why, if you havestomach, toet, monsieur. If you think
    your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour
    again into his native quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise,
    and go on;will grace the attempt forworthy exploit. If you  
    speed well in it, the Duke shall both speak of it and extend to
    you what further becomes his greatness, even to the utmost
    syllable of our worthiness.
  PAROLLES. By the hand ofsoldier,will undertake it.
  BERTRAM. But you must not now slumber in it.
  PAROLLES. Iell about it this evening; andwill presently pen
    down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my certainty, put myself
    into my mortal preparation; and by midnight look to hear further

    fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems to undertake this
    business, which he knows is not to be done; damns himself to do,
    and dares better be damn   than to do et.
  FIRST LORD. You do not know him, my lord, as we do. Certain it is  
    that he will steal himself intoman  favour, and forweek

    you have him ever after.
  BERTRAM. Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of this that
    so seriously he does address himself unto?
  SECOND LORD. None in the world; but return with an invention, and
    clap upon you two or three probable lies. But we have almost

Enter BERTRAM and DIANA

  BERTRAM. They told me that your name was Fontibell.
  DIANA. No, my good lord, Diana.
  BERTRAM. Titled goddess;
    And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,
    In your fine frame hath love no quality?
    If the quick fire of youth light not your mind,
    You are no maiden, butmonument;
    When you are dead, you should be suchone
    As you are now, for you are cold and stern;
    And now you should be as your mother was
    When your sweet self was got.
  DIANA. She then was honest.
  BERTRAM. So should you be.
  DIANA. No.
    My mother did but duty; such, my lord,
    As you owe to your wife.
  BERTRAM. No more oethat!  
   prithee do not strive against my vows.
   was compell   to her; butlove the
    By love  own sweet constraint, and will for ever
    Do thee all rights of service.
  DIANA. Ay, so you serve us
    Till we serve you; but when you have our roses
    You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves,
    And mock us with our bareness.
  BERTRAM. How havesworn!
  DIANA. eTis not the many oaths that makes the truth,
    But the plain single vow that is vow   true.
    What is not holy, that we swear not by,
    But take the High to witness. Then, pray you, tell me:
    Ifshould swear by Jove  great attributes
   lov   you dearly, would you believe my oaths
    Whendid love you ill? This has no holding,
    To swear by him whomprotest to love
    Thatwill work against him. Therefore your oaths
    Are words and poor conditions, but unseal  -
    At least in my opinion.  
  BERTRAM. Change it, change it;
    Be not so holy-cruel. Love is holy;
    And my integrity neeer knew the crafts
    That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,
    But give thyself unto my sick desires,
    Who then recovers. Say thou art mine, and ever
    My love as it begins shall so persever.
  DIANA.see that men make ropes in suchscarre
    That weell forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.
  BERTRAM. Iell lend it thee, my dear, but have no power
    To give it from me.
  DIANA. Will you not, my lord?
  BERTRAM. It is an honour elonging to our house,
    Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
    Which were the greatest obloquy ie the world
    In me to lose.
  DIANA. Mine honour  suchring:
    My chastity  the jewel of our house,
    Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
    Which were the greatest obloquy ie the world  
    In me to lose. Thus your own proper wisdom
    Brings in the champion Honour on my part
    Against your vain assault.
  BERTRAM. Here, take my ring;
    My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,
    And Iell be bid by thee.
  DIANA. When midnight comes, knock at my chamber window;
    Iell order take my mother shall not hear.
    Now willcharge you in the band of truth,
    When you have conquer   my yet maiden bed,
    Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:
    My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them
    When back again this ring shall be deliver  .
    And on your finger in the night Iell put
    Another ring, that what in time proceeds
    May token to the future our past deeds.
    Adieu till then; then fail not. You have won
   wife of me, though there my hope be done.
  BERTRAM.heaven on earthhave won by wooing thee.
 Exit  
  DIANA. For which live long to thank both heaven and me!
    You may so in the end.
    My mother told me just how he would woo,
    As if she sat in  heart; she says all men
    Have the like oaths. He had sworn to marry me
    When his wife  dead; therefore Iell lie with him
    Whenam buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,

The Florentine camp

Enter the two FRENCH LORDS, and two or three SOLDIERS

  SECOND LORD. You have not given him his mother  letter?
  FIRST LORD.have delivered it an hour since. There is something
    inet that stings his nature; for on the reading it he chang  
    almost into another man.
  SECOND LORD. He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off
    so goodwife and so sweetlady.
  FIRST LORD. Especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure
    of the King, who had even tun   his bounty to sing happiness to
    him.will tell youthing, but you shall let it dwell darkly
    with you.
  SECOND LORD. When you have spoken it, etis dead, andam the grave
    of it.
  FIRST LORD. He hath pervertedyoung gentlewoman here in Florence,
    ofmost chaste renown; and this night he fleshes his will in
    the spoil of her honour. He hath given her his monumental ring,
    and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition.
  SECOND LORD. Now, God delay our rebellion! As we are ourselves,  
    what things are we!
  FIRST LORD. Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course of
    all treasons we still see them reveal themselves till they attain
    to their abhorr   ends; so he that in this action contrives
    against his own nobility, in his proper stream, oeerflows
    himself.
  SECOND LORD. Is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our
    unlawful intents? We shall not then have his company to-night?
  FIRST LORD. Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.
  SECOND LORD. That approaches apace.would gladly have him see his
    company anatomiz  , that he might takemeasure of his own
    judgments, wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit.
  FIRST LORD. We will not meddle with him till he come; for his
    presence must be the whip of the other.
  SECOND LORD. In the meantime, what hear you of these wars?
  FIRST LORD.hear there is an overture of peace.
  SECOND LORD. Nay,assure you,peace concluded.
  FIRST LORD. What will Count Rousillon do then? Will he travel
    higher, or return again into France?
  SECOND LORD.perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether  
    of his counsel.
  FIRST LORD. Let it be forbid, sir! So shouldbegreat deal
    of his act.
  SECOND LORD. Sir, his wife, some two months since, fled from his
    house. Her pretence ispilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand;
    which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she
    accomplish  ; and, there residing, the tenderness of her nature
    became asprey to her grief; in fine, madegroan of her last
    breath, and now she sings in heaven.
  FIRST LORD. How is this justified?
  SECOND LORD. The stronger part of it by her own letters, which
    makes her story true even to the point of her death. Her death
    itself, which could not be her office to say is come, was
    faithfully confirm   by the rector of the place.
  FIRST LORD. Hath the Count all this intelligence?
  SECOND LORD. Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from
    point, to the full arming of the verity.
  FIRST LORD.am heartily sorry that heell be glad of this.
  SECOND LORD. How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our
    losses!  
  FIRST LORD. And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in
    tears! The great dignity that his valour hath here acquir   for
    him shall at home be encountered withshame as ample.
  SECOND LORD. The web of our life is ofmingled yarn, good and ill
    together. Our virtues would be proud if our faults whipt them
    not; and our crimes would despair if they were not cherish   by
    our virtues.

    How now? Where  your master?
  SERVANT. He met the Duke in the street, sir; of whom he hath taken
   solemn leave. His lordship will next morning for France. The
    Duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the King.
  SECOND LORD. They shall be no more than needful there, if they were
    more than they can commend.
  FIRST LORD. They cannot be too sweet for the King  tartness.
    Here  his lordship now.

                        Enter BERTRAM  

    How now, my lord, iset not after midnight?
  BERTRAM.have to-night dispatch   sixteen businesses,month 
    length apiece; by an abstract of success:have congied with the
    Duke, done my adieu with his nearest; buriedwife, mourn   for
    her; writ to my lady motheram returning; entertain   my
    convoy; and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many
    nicer needs. The last was the greatest, but thathave not ended
    yet.
  SECOND LORD. If the business be of any difficulty and this morning
    your departure hence, it requires haste of your lordship.
  BERTRAM.mean the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it
    hereafter. But shall we have this dialogue between the Fool and
    the Soldier? Come, bring forth this counterfeit module has
    deceiv   me likedouble-meaning prophesier.
  SECOND LORD. Bring him forth.  [Exeunt SOLDIERS]  Has sat ie the
    stocks all night, poor gallant knave.
  BERTRAM. No matter; his heels have deserv   it, in usurping his
    spurs so long. How does he carry himself?
  SECOND LORD.have told your lordship already the stocks carry  
    him. But to answer you as you would be understood: he weeps like
   wench that had shed her milk; he hath confess   himself to
    Morgan, whom he supposes to befriar, from the time of his
    remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting ie the
    stocks. And what think you he hath confess  ?
  BERTRAM.  of me, has ea?
  SECOND LORD. His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his
    face; if your lordship be inet, asbelieve you are, you must
    have the patience to hear it.

  BERTRAM.plague upon him! muffled! He can say  of me.
  SECOND LORD. Hush, hush! Hoodman comes. Portotartarossa.
  FIRST SOLDIER. He calls for the tortures. What will you say without
    eem?
  PAROLLES.will confess whatknow without constraint; if ye
    pinch me likepasty,can say no more.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Bosko chimurcho.  
  SECOND LORD. Boblibindo chicurmurco.
  FIRST SOLDIER. YOU aremerciful general. Our General bids you
    answer to whatshall ask you out ofnote.
  PAROLLES. And truly, ashope to live.
  FIRST SOLDIER. eFirst demand of him how many horse the Duke is
    strong.e What say you to that?
  PAROLLES. Five or six thousand; but very weak and unserviceable.
    The troops are all scattered, and the commanders very poor
    rogues, upon my reputation and credit, and ashope to live.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Shallset down your answer so?
  PAROLLES. Do; Iell take the sacrament on et, how and which way you
    will.
  BERTRAM. All  one to him. Whatpast-saving slave is this!
  SECOND LORD. Yeare deceiv  , my lord; this is Monsieur Parolles,
    the gallant militarist-that was his own phrase-that had the whole
    theoric of war in the knot of his scarf, and the practice in the
    chape of his dagger.
  FIRST LORD.will never trustman again for keeping his sword
    clean; nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his
    apparel neatly.  
  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that  set down.
  PAROLLES. eFive or six thousand horse aid-I will say true- eor
    thereaboutse set down, for Iell speak truth.
  SECOND LORD. He  very near the truth in this.

  PAROLLES. ePoor roguesepray you say.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that  set down.
  PAROLLES.humbly thank you, sir.truth truth-the rogues are
    marvellous poor.
  FIRST SOLDIER.   emand of him of what strength they are a-foot.e
    What say you to that?
  PAROLLES. By my troth, sir, ifwere to live this present hour, I
    will tell true. Let me see: Spurio,hundred and fifty;
    Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian,
    Cosmo, Lodowick, and Grat  , two hundred fifty each; mine own
    company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bent  , two hundred fifty each; so
    that the muster-file, rotten and sound, upon my life, amounts not
    to fifteen thousand poll; half of the which dare not shake the
    snow from off their cassocks lest they shake themselves to
    pieces.  
  BERTRAM. What shall be done to him?
  SECOND LORD. , but let him have thanks. Demand of him my
    condition, and what credithave with the Duke.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, that  set down. eYou shall demand of him
    whether one Captain Dumain be ie the camp,Frenchman; what his
    reputation is with the Duke, what his valour, honesty, expertness
    in wars; or whether he thinks it were not possible, with
    well-weighing sums of gold, to corrupt him torevolt.e What say
    you to this? What do you know of it?
  PAROLLES.beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the
    interegatories. Demand them singly.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Do you know this Captain Dumain?
  PAROLLES.know him: ea wasbotcher  prentice in Paris, from
    whence he was whipt for getting the shrieve  fool with child-a
    dumb innocent that could not say him nay.
  BERTRAM. Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; thoughknow his
    brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Well, is this captain in the Duke of Florence 
    camp?
  PAROLLES. Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.  
  SECOND LORD. Nay, look not so upon me; we shall hear of your
    lordship anon.
  FIRST SOLDIER. What is his reputation with the Duke?
  PAROLLES. The Duke knows him for no other butpoor officer of
    mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him out oe the band.
   thinkhave his letter in my pocket.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Marry, weell search.
  PAROLLES. In good sadness,do not know; either it is there or it
    is uponfile with the Duke  other letters in my tent.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Here etis; here paper. Shallread it to you?
  PAROLLES.do not know if it be it or no.
  BERTRAM. Our interpreter does it well.
  SECOND LORD. Excellently.
  FIRST SOLDIER.  [Reads]    ian, the Count fool, and full of
    gold.e
  PAROLLES. That is not the Duke  letter, sir; that is an
    advertisement toproper maid in Florence, one Diana, to take
    heed of the allurement of one Count Rousillon,foolish idle
    boy, but for all that very ruttish.pray you, sir, put it up
    again.  
  FIRST SOLDIER. Nay, Iell read it first by your favour.
  PAROLLES. My meaning inet,protest, was very honest in the behalf
    of the maid; forknew the young Count to bedangerous and
    lascivious boy, who iswhale to virginity, and devours up all
    the fry it finds.
  BERTRAM. Damnable both-sides rogue!
  FIRST SOLDIER.                                         [Reads]
    eWhen he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;
    After he scores, he never pays the score.
    Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;
    He neeer pays after-debts, take it before.
    And saysoldier, Dian, told thee this:
    Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss;
    For count of this, the Count fool,know it,
    Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.

  BERTRAM. He shall be whipt through the army with this rhyme in 
    forehead.
  FIRST LORD. This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold  
    linguist, and the amnipotent soldier.
  BERTRAM.could endure anything before butcat, and now he  a
    cat to me.
  FIRST SOLDIER.perceive, sir, by our General  looks we shall be
    fain to hang you.
  PAROLLES. My life, sir, in any case! Not thatam afraid to die,
    but that, my offences being many,would repent out the
    remainder of nature. Let me live, sir, indungeon, ie the
    stocks, or anywhere, somay live.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Weell see what may be done, so you confess freely;
    therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you have answer   to
    his reputation with the Duke, and to his valour; what is his
    honesty?
  PAROLLES. He will steal, sir, an egg out ofcloister; for rapes
    and ravishments he parallels Nessus. He professes not keeping of
    oaths; in breaking eem he is stronger than Hercules. He will lie,
    sir, with such volubility that you would think truth werefool.
    Drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be swine-drunk; and
    in his sleep he does little harm, save to his bedclothes about
    him; but they know his conditions and lay him in straw.have  
    but little more to say, sir, of his honesty. He has everything
    that an honest man should not have; what an honest man should
    have he has .
  SECOND LORD.begin to love him for this.
  BERTRAM. For this description of thine honesty?pox upon him! For
    me, he  more and morecat.
  FIRST SOLDIER. What say you to his expertness in war?
  PAROLLES. Faith, sir, has led the drum before the English
    tragedians-to belie himwill not-and more of his soldier-ship
   know not, except in that country he had the honour to be the
    officer atplace there called Mile-end to instruct for the
    doubling of files-I would do the man what honourcan-but of
    thisam not certain.
  SECOND LORD. He hath out-villain   villainy so far that the rarity
    redeems him.
  BERTRAM.pox on him! he cat still.
  FIRST SOLDIER. His qualities being at this poor price,need not
    to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.
  PAROLLES. Sir, forcardecue he will sell the fee-simple of his
    salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut the entail from all  
    remainders andperpetual succession for it perpetually.
  FIRST SOLDIER. What  his brother, the other Captain Dumain?
  FIRST LORD. Why does he ask him of me?
  FIRST SOLDIER. What  he?
  PAROLLES. Eeencrow oe the same nest; not altogether so great as
    the first in goodness, but greatergreat deal in evil. He
    excels his brother forcoward; yet his brother is reputed one
    of the best that is. Inretreat he outruns any lackey: marry,
    in coming on he has the cramp.
  FIRST SOLDIER. If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray
    the Florentine?
  PAROLLES. Ay, and the Captain of his Horse, Count Rousillon.
  FIRST SOLDIER. Iell whisper with the General, and know his
    pleasure.
  PAROLLES.  [Aside]  Iell no more drumming.plague of all drums!
    Only to seem to deserve well, and to beguile the supposition of
    that lascivious young boy the Count, haverun into this danger.
    Yet who would have suspected an ambush wherewas taken?
  FIRST SOLDIER. There is no remedy, sir, but you must die.
    The General says you that have so traitorously discover   the  
    secrets of your army, and made such pestiferous reports of men
    very nobly held, can serve the world for no honest use; therefore
    you must die. Come, headsman, of with his head.
  PAROLLES.Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!
  FIRST SOLDIER. That shall you, and take your leave of all your
    friends.  [Unmuffling him]  So look about you; know you any here?
  BERTRAM. Good morrow, noble Captain.
  FIRST LORD. God bless you, Captain Parolles.
  SECOND LORD. God save you, noble Captain.
  FIRST LORD. Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu?am
    for France.
  SECOND LORD. Good Captain, will you give mecopy of the sonnet
    you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon? Anwere not
   very coward   compel it of you; but fare you well.
                                        Exeunt BERTRAM and LORDS
  FIRST SOLDIER. You are undone, Captain, all but your scarf; that
    hasknot on et yet.
  PAROLLES. Who cannot be crush   withplot?
  FIRST SOLDIER. If you could find outcountry where but women were
    that had received so much shame, you might begin an impudent  
    nation. Fare ye well, sir;am for France too; we shall speak of
    you there.                                Exit with SOLDIERS
  PAROLLES. Yet amthankful. If my heart were great,
    eTwould burst at this. Captain Iell be no more;
    Butwill eat, and drink, and sleep as soft
    As captain shall. Simply the thingam
    Shall make me live. Who knows himselfbraggart,
    Let him fear this; for it will come to pass
    That every braggart shall be found an ass.
    Rust, sword; cool, blushes; and, Parolles, live
    Safest in shame. Being fool  , by foolery thrive.
    There  place and means for every man alive.
    Iell after them.                                        Exit

    That can such sweet use make of what they hate,
    When saucy trusting of the cozen   thoughts
    Defiles the pitchy night. So lust doth play
    With what it loathes, for that which is away.
    But more of this hereafter. You, Diana,
    Under my poor instructions yet must suffer
    Something in my behalf.
  DIANA. Let death and honesty
    Go with your impositions,am yours
    Upon your will to suffer.
  HELENA. Yet,pray you:
    But with the word the time will bring on summer,
    When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns
    And be as sweet as sharp. We must away;  
    Our waggon is prepar  , and time revives us.
    All  Well that Ends Well. Still the fine  the crown.
    Whateeer the course, the end is the renown.           Exeunt

Enter COUNTESS, LAFEU, and CLOWN

  LAFEU. No, no, no, son was misled withsnipt-taffeta fellow
    there, whose villainous saffron would have made all the unbak  
    and doughy youth ofnation in his colour. Your daughter-in-law
    had been alive at this hour, and your son here at home, more
    advanc   by the King than by that red-tail   humble-beespeak
    of.
  COUNTESS.wouldhad not known him. It was the death of the most
    virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating. If
    she had partaken of my flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a
    mother.could not have owed hermore rooted love.
  LAFEU. eTwasgood lady, etwasgood lady. We may pickthousand
    sallets ere we light on such another herb.
  CLOWN. Indeed, sir, she was the sweet-marjoram of the sallet, or,
    rather, the herb of grace.
  LAFEU. They are not sallet-herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.
  CLOWN.am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir;have not much skill in
    grass.  
  LAFEU. Whether dost thou profess thyself-a knave orfool?
  CLOWN.fool, sir, atwoman  service, andknave atman .
  LAFEU. Your distinction?
  CLOWN.would cozen the man of his wife, and do his service.
  LAFEU. So you wereknave at his service, indeed.
  CLOWN. Andwould give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.
  LAFEU.will subscribe for thee; thou art both knave and fool.
  CLOWN. At your service.
  LAFEU. No, no, no.
  CLOWN. Why, sir, ifcannot serve you,can serve as great a
    prince as you are.
  LAFEU. Who  that?Frenchman?
  CLOWN. Faith, sir, ea has an English name; but his fisnomy is more
    hotter in France than there.
  LAFEU. What prince is that?
  CLOWN. The Black Prince, sir; alias, the Prince of Darkness; alias,
    the devil.
  LAFEU. Hold thee, there  my purse.give thee not this to suggest
    thee from thy master thou talk of; serve him still.
  CLOWN.amwoodland fellow, sir, that always lovedgreat fire;  
    and the masterspeak of ever keepsgood fire. But, sure, he
    is the prince of the world; let his nobility remain in  court. I
    am for the house with the narrow gate, whichtake to be too
    little for pomp to enter. Some that humble themselves may; but
    the many will be too chill and tender: and theyell be for the
    flowery way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
  LAFEU. Go thy ways,begin to be aweary of thee; andtell thee
    so before, becausewould not fall out with thee. Go thy ways;
    let my horses be well look   to, without any tricks.
  CLOWN. Ifput any tricks upon eem, sir, they shall be jadese
    tricks, which are their own right by the law of nature.
 Exit
  LAFEU.shrewd knave, and an unhappy.
  COUNTESS. So ea is. My lord that  gone made himself much  sport
    out of him. By his authority he remains here, which he thinks is
   patent for his sauciness; and indeed he has no pace, but runs
    where he will.
  LAFEU.like him well; etis not amiss. Andwas about to tell
    you, sinceheard of the good lady  death, and that my lord
    your son was upon his return home,moved the King my master to  
    speak in the behalf of my daughter; which, in the minority of
    them both, his Majesty out ofself-gracious remembrance did
    first propose. His Highness hath promis   me to do it; and, to
    stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against your son, there
    is no fitter matter. How does your ladyship like it?
  COUNTESS. With very much content, my lord; andwish it happily
    effected.
  LAFEU. His Highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able body as
    when he number   thirty; ea will be here to-morrow, oram
    deceiv   by him that in such intelligence hath seldom fail  .
  COUNTESS. It rejoices me thathopeshall see him eredie.
   have letters that my son will be here to-night.shall beseech
    your lordship to remain with me tal they meet together.
  LAFEU. Madam,was thinking with what mannersmight safely be
    admitted.
  COUNTESS. You need but plead your honourable privilege.
  LAFEU. Lady, of thathave madebold charter; but,thank my
    God, it holds yet.

  CLOWN.madam, yonder  my lord your son withpatch of velvet
    on  face; whether there bescar under et or no, the velvet
    knows; but etisgoodly patch of velvet. His left cheek is a
    cheek of two pile andhalf, but his right cheek is worn bare.
  LAFEU.scar nobly got, ornoble scar, isgood livery of
    honour; so belike is that.
  CLOWN. But it is your carbonado   face.
  LAFEU. Let us go see your son,pray you;
   long to talk with the young noble soldier.
  CLOWN. Faith, there dozen of eem, with delicate fine hats, and
    most courteous feathers, which bow the head and nod at every man.
                                                          Exeunt
